There are reports around claiming that semen being good for women (and men) with claimed benefits ranging from improved skin-tone, it being rich in nutrients, all the way to it being a cure for cancer (all of it...). Now, I don't care about the extreme claims - but is there reason to believe that ingesting semen has positive effects on human health?

<p>I think <a href="http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/swallowing-your-partners-ejaculate">this</a> source sums it up pretty well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In conclusion, with a possible exception for couples who have recently conceived, any health benefits that arise from swallowing semen are most likely entirely psychological effects, or are at least better associated with the health benefits of sex in general.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the "nutrition" table shows, it would take a generous amount of semen to actually benefit from it. Macronutrients as well as micronutrients are only present in trace amount, which would make semen unlikely to have any positive effect. </p>
