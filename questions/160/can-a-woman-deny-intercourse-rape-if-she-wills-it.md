This logic, if holds true, has quite a profound implication: a woman can actually deny rape if she wants to!

But seriously, is it true that a woman's body can deny intercourse as she wills it?

<p>No, this is not true. 
I'm not sure what "body would shutdown" mean. Just like any other muscles in the body, vaginal/anal muscles also have a limit in their strength and can be overcome. So how can the victims' body just not allow rape</p>

<p>Same argument would then continue that victim secretly wanted it. From <a href="http://www.survivormanual.com/2011/02/what-if-my-body-had-a-sexual-response-during-rape/"> What if my body had a sexual response during rape? </a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, the production of moisture in her vagina was not a result of physical or psychological desire for what was happening to her. On the contrary, it was a form of self-defense. Her body had adapted to the sexual assault by responding in a way that would minimize injury and reduce the sensations of pain by secreting fluid so that the invasion by a penis would be less physically severe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear that some times victims body's defense actions are misinterpreted as a sexual response. Rape is an act of power and violence, I can't see anyway to "not allow" it</p>

#No, it is not true.

Claiming that women can choose to not be raped is tantamount to saying that rape doesn't exist.  This is both incorrect and an incredibly dangerous thing to say.  

Think about what this lunatic judge is saying:  Women only have sex if and when they want to have sex. If this were true, it would mean that no woman has ever had sex against her will.  In effect, the argument is that rape doesn't really exist, and all sex is inherently consensual.

#This is not the case.  I can't stress this enough:  rape is real, and the victims are *victims*, not willing participants.  

##They didn't allow it to happen, they didn't bring it on themselves, and they weren't "asking for it".  The blame - all of it - lies firmly on the shoulders of the rapist, not the victim. It is morally abhorrent, factually incorrect, and completely inexcusable to suggest otherwise.
