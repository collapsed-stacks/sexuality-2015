Due to the influence of the TV I grew up, I've seen that some women might fake an orgasm for some reason or another.

How can I know if my partner is faking her orgasm or not?

You find out by asking her.

I would strongly suggest you avoid any other way of determining if she is faking, even if it were to be possible for you to experimentally find out.

The good thing about actual communication is that you might also find out why she would fake it, and what you two can do to make the whole a more pleasurable experience.

The only way to know for sure is to ask and trust your partner is being honest. However, there are physiological indicators. While none of these are guaranteed, they may help:

* If you are used to your partner (i.e. you are in a long-term sexual relationship and not a one-night stand) you should be able to tell based on how she acts at the alleged point of climax. Orgasms can be quite powerful to the point that it is difficult to control one's body or portions thereof.

* Her vaginal opening may constrict as the muscles in that area flex.

* Her back may move, e.g. arching backward.

* Her facial expression may change.

Everyone is different, male and female. Everyone has a slightly different different way of expressing themselves in all areas of life, including sex. This goes back to the first point: be familiar with your partner if you want to know if she is faking or not. More importantly, make the necessary connection to her so she does not _need_ to fake it for whatever reason. Find out what makes her orgasm for real, and the idea of "faking" will not even be an issue.

A good way of physically telling if a female (or male) is experiencing an orgasm is to insert the tip of your finger into their anus. The muscles around the anus will contract on orgasm and you will be able to feel this. (I can't remember where I originally found this tip, but it does work).

However, the other answers are correct in that you are better off having an honest conversation with your partner. If you have a good relationship, they could be faking it to not hurt your feelings or pride, and you should be able to bring this up with them and communicate your worries.
