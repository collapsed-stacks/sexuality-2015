Suppose a male is physically stimulated from anal penetration (does not have to be intercourse, can be even just a finger) - does it automatically defines him as Homosexual or Bisexual?

Or are those defined only by the mentality and feelings i.e. the above male is considered Heterosexual unless he also feels actual attraction to other men?

Probably not.

It's important to clarify what's meant by "homosexual": it refers to someone who exhibits sexual attraction to, or sexual behavior with someone of the same sex. That's a commonly accepted definition, and while some argue that there's an emotional component, that's not as relevant to this question so I'm ignoring it here.

It's also important to clarify that homo/heterosexuality is not a binary state. The [Kinsey Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale) is a good demonstration; one is not _either_ hetero _or_ homosexual, and people can change in both the shorter and longer term. 

That being said, the case you're talking about refers to [sexual arousal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_arousal) by anal stimulation, which isn't necessarily related to being hetero/homosexual. While the two are obviously related in some cases, it isn't necessary that they are. Since they can be independent, enjoying anal stimulation does not imply homosexuality. 

As an example, suppose our hypothetical male was only comfortable if a female were doing it. The requirement for sexual desire for the same sex wouldn't be fulfilled, but the arousal would.

Wikipedia defines both of them in terms of behaviour and attraction :-

[Homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality) 

> Homosexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual
> behavior between members of the same sex or gender. As a sexual
> orientation, homosexuality is "an enduring pattern of emotional,
> romantic, and/or sexual attractions" primarily or exclusively to
> people of the same sex.

[Heterosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality)

> Heterosexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual
> behavior between persons of opposite sex or gender. As a sexual
> orientation, heterosexuality is "an enduring pattern of emotional,
> romantic, and/or sexual attractions" to persons of the opposite sex;
> it "also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those
> attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of
> others who share those attractions.

Your question :-

> automatically defines him as Homosexual or Bisexual?

So, no, this will not entitle him to be a homosexual if he is simulated from self-actions. *That just serves as a source to simulate him, he is not getting bounded to perform that act only. He may wish to choose mating with female/male next.* It is kind of ***fetish*** act.

If he also feels the same when a women performs the anal act with some tool, then it obviously is because of the fetishness ***again***.

Sexual orientation is soley defined by the feelings.

For example a male in not homesexual when he enjoys anal sex. There are many instance where to recive anal sex no other male is required (for example a female using a strap-on dildo).
