## Is there any scale for the intensity of orgasms?

From personal experience, I can tell for sure that the intensity of orgasms can vary a lot.

Has there been any serious study to build some sort of "Orgasm intensity scale" same way we have Richter magnitude scale for earthquakes? (naturally, one for males and one for females)

<p>Lab studies generally use a simple N point self-ranking scale, where 1 = least intense, N = most intense, and (N+1)/2 = average intensity.  There's usually no effort to deal with problem of "What if my 3 is your 7?" which makes such rankings not very useful for interpersonal comparisons.  However, such scales can be useful for comparing two different orgasms by the same woman.</p>

<p>"<em><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/4062540/" rel="nofollow">Orgasm in women in the laboratory--quantitative studies on duration, intensity, latency, and vaginal blood flow</a></em>," the paper Lindes mentioned in a comment, is a good example of a study using a 5 point scale.  Hartman and Fithian used an 11-point (0-10) scale in their monumental lab studies.</p>

<p>Noting the deficiency in lateral consistency, Kenneth Mah and Yitzchak Binik created an <em>Orgasm Rating Scale</em>, or ORS, an adjective-rich attempt at <a href="http://www.binik-lab.com/pdf/3.pdf" rel="nofollow">a scale for measuring the <em>psychological</em> characteristics of orgasm</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[W]e developed a theoretically based psychometric instrument to evaluate
  the subjective experience of orgasm (Mah &amp; Binik, 2002). This
  adjective-ratings questionnaire, the Orgasm Rating Scale (ORS), was
  based on Davidson’s (1980) and Warner’s (1981) two dimensions of the
  orgasm experience, which we refer to as the sensory and
  cognitive-affective dimensions.</p>
  
  <p>The sensory dimension encompasses sensations arising from the
  physiological events of orgasm, whereas the cognitive-affective
  dimension relates to the affective and evaluative experiences
  associated with orgasm experiences. Both dimensions also comprise
  empirically developed components (see Mah &amp; Binik, 2002, for details
  on model development). </p>
  
  <p>The conceptual model of the subjective orgasm experience thus includes
  two overarching dimensions (cognitive-affective, sensory), four
  cognitive-affective components (pleasurable satisfaction, relaxation,
  emotional intimacy, ecstasy), six sensory components (building
  sensations, flooding sensations, flushing sensations, shooting
  sensations, throbbing sensations, general spasms), and 28 adjectives
  representing their respective components. </p>
  
  <p>Evaluation of this model indicated good-to-excellent model fit to data
  from a large sample of university students and also to data from an
  independent cross-validation sample of university students (Mah &amp;
  Binik, 2002). Factorial invariance across gender was supported,
  suggesting that the two-dimensional factor structure provides an
  adequate model of the subjective orgasm experience for both men and
  women (Mah &amp; Binik, 2002). </p>
  
  <p>As we hypothesized, mean scores for the pleasurable satisfaction
  component were significantly higher for both genders in the
  sex-with-partner context than in the solitary masturbation context
  (Mah &amp; Binik, 2002).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ORS has been used by other researchers since then, so apparently it fills a useful niche.</p>

<p>However, what I think you <strong>really</strong> want is *<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1412913365" rel="nofollow">The Handbook of Sexuality-Related Measures</a>, by Terri D. Fisher, Clive M. Davis, William L. Yarber, Sandra L. Davis, which includes the ORS and 200 other attempts at constructing moderately reliable ways to track subjective sexual experiences.</p>
