The [legal status of prostitution is quite varied around the globe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution#Legality).

And as it is often referred to as "the oldest profession," even stories from ancient civilizations talk about prostitution as a matter of fact.  The ancient text which I am most familiar is the Hebrew bible, which talks about prostitution in a negative light, but as far as I know, makes no mention or allusion to it being *illegal*.

I'm curious which is the first locality (nation, state, city-state, etc) to make prostitution *illegal*.
