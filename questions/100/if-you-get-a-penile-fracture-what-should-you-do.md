If you get a penile fracture during intercourse, what should you do? Of course you should go to the hospital, but what steps should you take in terms of first aid?  Put ice on it?  Keep it steady or immobilized?

<p>Paraphrasing an article on <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/caseygueren/how-to-not-break-your-penis" rel="nofollow">Buzzfeed</a> titled "<em>How to Not Break Your Penis</em>":</p>

<p>You should keep it elevated (pointing to your nose) to help it heal. If your penis is hanging down all day in boxer shorts, even a minor injury at the base will travel to the head of the penis and cause severe swelling.</p>

<p>You need to see a urologist within 24 hours, because all studies show that if the patient is seen by a doctor within 24 hours, then the outcomes are excellent. As <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02461.x/abstract" rel="nofollow">50% of penile fractures occur in affairs</a>, going to the hospital may be a difficult but necessary decision.</p>

<p>The doctor will do an ultrasound or MRI to assess the damage. If it's a fracture, they'll do an immediate operation where they use sutures to close the defects. If it's just a small tear, your penis might just need some ice packs and a three- to four-week vacation from sex.</p>
