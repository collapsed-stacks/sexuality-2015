I have heard about the P-spot in males, where is it, and how should it be stimulated? How does it differ from the G-spot? What happens when you stimulate it, does it feel different than an ordinary orgasm?

This is just a term (not sure if slang or official) for the male G-spot, which if exists, should be in the prostate. (hence the "P")

It differs from the G-spot in its location, naturally, and by the means to reach it.

Supposedly, when the male G-spot is stimulated via something called prostate massage, the male can reach instant orgasm, and from what I heard even ejaculation without  orgasm.

The only semi-reliable source I found so far is this wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_massage (probably since this isn't scientific to begin with)
