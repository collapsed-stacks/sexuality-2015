Many people nowadays have unprotected coitus. Many people have told me that the pull-out method (a.k.a. withdrawal) is a good method to prevent pregnancy.

But, I have my doubts. How reliable is the aforementioned method, as far as pregnancy is concerned?

**Not good**.

The pre-ejaculate may arrive well before the orgasm, sometimes at the very beginning of intercourse, and this can fertilise an egg, as [this semi-scientific source](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/birth-control/expert-answers/birth-control/faq-20058518) also claims.

Pulling out decreases the likelihood of pregnancy **somewhat**, as a woman is more likely to get pregnant if a man ejaculates fully inside her, however:

 1. Semen can come out before ejaculation, known as pre-ejaculate (aka pre-cum). This can lead to pregnancy
 2. A man can lose control when close to orgasm, and forget to pull out

So use a condom, it's much more reliable than pulling out and it will protect you against STD's too.
