Does removing pubic hairs affect a person's sexual feelings? 

Like, if I have genital hairs, am I supposed to feel/dream more about sex than the other case?

Except from the possible pull to the hair, removing the gental hair doesn't affect the sexual feelings.

The only person that will realy notice a difference is your partner. Not neccessary in a sexual way but you certainly notice the existence or absence of gential hair.

It depends on how much hair is present and the nature of the activity. Generally the answer is yes, the region becomes more sensitive, as more nerve endings are simulated, especially in cases of fresh removal of hair, and in cases of excessive hair. It's really a matter of preference for your partner, but it should feel better for you, even if it's just masturbation.

This might differ from person to person, but I believe it is similar to having a beard.

Some women like men with beards and some don't. Some of them might feel a kiss better when the man is shaved (or not), so the same can happen to the genital area hair. I've met people that say they don't like these kind of hair; they are turned off. So, in a way it affects the sexual feelings.

Different people have different hair growth patterns and different preferences and ideas about what's attractive.

Like a lot of South Asians, I was a blessed with an overabundance in this department, and I definitely feel sexier with most of it gone.  I shave all the hair *outside* the outline of a skimpy bikini bottom and trim all the hair *inside* that outline. This makes me feel more feminine and attractive, so it indirectly makes sex more enjoyable.

I've tried shaving my labia and once tried a Brazilian wax job, but the bare skin gets irritated, stubble is a pain (literally), and the bare "little girl" look is a turnoff for my partner, so going too far also turns out to have negative indirect sexual consequences for me.

On the other hand, I make my guy shave the hair from his shaft and scrotum and trim his bush fairly short, because getting pubic hairs in my mouth or throat during oral is a HUGE turnoff for me.

As far as I can tell, the physical presence or absence of hair has nothing at all to do with sexual sensation or pleasure.  It's the practical effects (comfort and convenience) and the emotional and esthetic ones (self-image and erotic appeal) that make sex better when you find just the right type and degree of ladyscaping and manscaping for the two of you.
