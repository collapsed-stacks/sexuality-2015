My wife and I are not ready to have children yet.  Condoms are fun-killers.  We don't like playing with hormones (and we already know my wife has some adverse affects to using "[the ring](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring)").

What non-hormonal birth control options exist for us to consider?

Naturally, we don't want surgery, as we *do* intend to have children in the next 12-24 months, just not yet.

A [Copper IUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUD_with_copper) seems to fit your requirements:

1. The copper acts as a spermicide and does not have a hormonal effect. (Of note: hormonal IUDs are [slightly more effective](http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/unintendedpregnancy/contraception.htm) at pregnancy prevention.)
2. Once the IUD is placed, it is virtually unnoticeable to either partner.
3. IUDs can be removed via a simple outpatient procedure if you decide to pursue pregnancy.

My wife and I tried several types of birth control and this was the one we found most fit our (similar) requirements. As a word of caution, a copper IUD failed to prevent pregnancy [in our case](http://christianity.blogoverflow.com/2012/03/05/an-evangelical-view-of-contraception/). [No method is perfectly reliable.](http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/a/38/7)

If you don't want the expense and insertion of an IUD, consider asking your doctor about the Diaphragm. It's a little cup you insert into your vagina, forming a barrier between the vagina and the uterus. Used in conjunction with spermacide, it has a failure rate of 6%. You leave it in for a little while after sex (approximately 6 hours) so everything settles down before you remove it

Similar to the diaphragm, there's also the sponge, the cervical cap, and the "Lea Shield" (a brand name, one-size diaphragm).
