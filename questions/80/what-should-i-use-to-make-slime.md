I recently mixed up some "slime" for my wife and I to put on each other before/during sex. I initially used a mixture of cornstarch and water (oobleck), but when it seemed too sticky I added some flour.

It worked OK, but:

- It was still pretty sticky. As I rubbed it onto her body, some that was already there would stick to my hand. It was very difficult to get any kind of coverage due to this.
- It dried out pretty fast. By the time we were done (20-30 minutes), it wasn't a slime so much as a dough.
- Unfortunately, I don't remember the exact ratios used. It was probably close to equal parts of each ingredient though.

**What ingredients/ratios can I use to make a slime that:**

- Stays slimy longer, at least half an hour in contact with skin.
- Is easy to spread around. It should basically stay where I put it.
- Is cheap/easy to make, no expensive or hard to get ingredients.
- Is relatively easy to wash off (ie. with a shower)

We only put it on our torsos, so it doesn't have to be safe for internal use. It would be great if it *was* though.

Nuru gel seems to be a good choice, very slimy substance. Made from Nori seaweed and is completely safe to ingest.

 Don't know if that is too expensive or not. Should be available in online shops.

J-Lube seems also to be a good choice, used by special effects artists (so I guess it is considered slimy enough, and cheap enough to use.

Another good source of information http://www.anus.org/SEX/jlube.html#whouse

J-lube, 100%. It's Obstetrics Lubric Powder, which means that it's instant mix lube used for animal birthing. It stays put, it's thick, and it's easily revived with a touch of water. Since it's powder, it will be easy for you to play with water/powder ratios until you achieve what you want. 

It's non-toxic (they stick this in cow vaginas usually), and one tin will last you a very long time, depending on how much lube you use at one time.

Only problem is J-lube is very very persistent... unless you use a salt water mixture. But since it's your torso, I think that should be okay. Messes can be cleaned up the same way, by soaking the effected area in salt.
