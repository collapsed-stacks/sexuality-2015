I'm male and when I shave my pubes, I always get a lot of pimples everywhere down there.

I'm shaving against the direction of the hair, because it doesn't work the other way. And I don't use after shave, because I feel this makes it even worse.

And I only get pimples when shaving pubes, not so in the armpits or the face.

**Question:** How do I shave so I won't get pimples?

Use aftershave, I use it every time I shave and don't develop razor burn or pimples.

Also consider using an electric razor instead of a manual as it helps avoid cuts. Several explicitly say they can be used near the genitals, and I would use one of those.

This used to happen to me as well a few years back. Back then I used a manual razor and because my skin is sensitive, I used to get pimples all over the place. But I asked my dermatologist and she said that I should try an electric razor. Since then, I've never had any pimples. Also, I would suggest you use shaving foam as well. 

<sub>I also got pimples when I used a manual razor on my face as well; my skin is really sensitive</sub>

I shave with a manual razor while in the shower. Shampoo the area well beforehand, shave away what you need, then dry when you get out of the shower. You can also rub some deodorant over the area to help with the irritation.
