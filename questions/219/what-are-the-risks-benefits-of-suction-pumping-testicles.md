I have heard that penis pumps can help heighten arousal (when used correctly of course!), and I recently learned that you can get 'whole-package' pumps that fit around both the penis and scrotum at the same time.

Is this wise? What sort of benefits would one be getting from pumping the testicles? How risky would this be, in regards to damage/infertility?

As requested, [here are the pumps in question][1] (NSFW). Note they are built to fit over the entirety of the penis & scrotum.
