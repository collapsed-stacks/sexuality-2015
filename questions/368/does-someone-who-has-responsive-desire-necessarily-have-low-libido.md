Sex therapists and sex educators sometimes make a distinction between a) people who often feel sexual desire spontaneously and b) people who seldom experience desire unless they are in a sexual and/or intimate situation. Is the latter true only for people with low libido, or is it possible for a person with relatively high libido to also fit the "responsive desire" pattern?
