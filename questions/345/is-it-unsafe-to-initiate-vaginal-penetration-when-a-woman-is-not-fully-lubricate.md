What risks, if any, exist when initiating vaginal penetration before the woman is fully lubricated?

Note this is not asking about conducting the full gamut of intercourse un-lubricated.  Assume that the woman will, within moments of penetration, reach full lubrication.

The obvious "risk" is pain for the woman - without the natural lubrication, chances for pain during the penetration and intercourse are quite high.

There are also more risks though, and more severe, as described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_sex):

>Removing or preventing vaginal lubrication through practices associated with dry sex increase friction during intercourse, which may be perceived as increased vaginal tightness, and enhanced sexual pleasure for the male partner.

And health risks:

>The practice has been linked to the high incidence of HIV/AIDS infection in Sub-Saharan Africa. The practice is regarded as increasing the risk of transmitting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) for both partners, including HIV in a number of ways. Increased friction during intercourse may cause lacerations in vaginal tissue. Drying the vagina also removes the natural antiseptic lactobacilli which can combat sexually transmitted diseases. Furthermore, dry sex increases the risk that a condom will break because of the increased friction. It may also result in vaginal inflammation and/or traumatic lesions which in turn may increase the transmission of STDs in other ways.

While the above quotes are about drying the vagina on purpose, at least parts of this are relevant when the vagina is simply dry to begin with, especially higher risk for HIV infection. (assuming of course the male doesn't use a condom)

<p>It is not only unsafe, it is rude, cruel, uncouth, and stupid. If you don't have lube, use spit, lots of it. Take the time to kiss her, stroke her body, and use oral and manual sex to get her aroused. If oral sex is against your religion, then rub your genitals against her vulva and clitoris until she's wet. No religion I know of forbids outercourse.</p>

<p>The primary risks of sex with inadequate lubrication are:</p>

<ul>
<li>pain</li>
<li>tearing of fragile tissues</li>
<li>bleeding</li>
<li>increased risk of infection</li>
<li>increased chance of bursting a condom</li>
<li>increased chance of a condom getting stuck in the vagina and being stripped off the penis on the out-stroke  </li>
<li>having your partner push you off and refuse to have sex with you</li>
</ul>

<p>Why in the world would <strong><em>anyone</em></strong> assume such an insanely improbable thing?  If she's in serious pain, do you think she's going to become instantly aroused by the magic touch of a penis?</p>

<p>Sorry, but NO.  It doesn't work that way. If she is dry at the start, it is a better assumption that the only lubricant will be blood and eventually semen.  And this is sounding a lot more like rape than consensual sex.</p>

<p>FWIW, most of the myth about "popping the cherry" and torn hymens as a marker of virginity comes from the sometimes severe bleeding that occurs when a man simply rams his way into a frightened girl's dry vagina.</p>

  <p>Although the vagina can withstand quite a lot when it comes to sex, it
  remains a very sensitive part of women’s bodies. The vagina can easily
  tear during sex, especially when the sex is full of friction as can
  occur during sex that is not well lubricated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lack of sufficient lubrication is a problem for many women, especially
  those who experience arousal problems, women on certain medications or
  those going through the menopause as it can make intercourse quite
  painful (for both man and woman) and cause tearing, inflammation and
  irritation while destroying the natural bacteria. ...</p>
  
  <p>Research by Van Andel has shown that dry sex damages the epithelium
  of the vagina and can lead to lacerations, inflammations, and the
  suppression of the vagina’s natural bacteria, all of which increase
  the likelihood of infection with sexually transmitted infections,
