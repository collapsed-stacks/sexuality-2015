Can the condom ever go on a flaccid penis? 

While manuals may advise to put on the condom on an erect penis, can it go on a flaccid penis instead?

<p>Putting a condom on an erect penis makes sure that it is properly in place. By that, I mean that the penis won't gain anymore size and that way the condom won't move. 
The correct way to put on a condom can be found <a href="http://sexuality.about.com/od/contraception/ht/putoncondom.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> .</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are uncircumcised,Â pull back your foreskin before rolling the condom on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the major reason as to why the condom might move if put on a flaccid penis, in which case the foreskin is not easily pulled back.</p>

<p>Also, remember that you must pinch the tip of the condom to collect the semen (as seen <a href="http://www.avert.org/images/6110-how-put-condom-diagrams" rel="nofollow">here</a>). </p>

<p>If put on a flaccid penis, this space might not be accounted for.</p>

To begin with, there's the practical problem:  trying to put a soft penis into a condom is like trying to push a rope - it tends to twist and fold and squirm away from the direction it's supposed to go.  If you've ever tried it, you know it's not easy. (There's a trick to it; see below.)

Second, it's hard to do this without getting air trapped at the end of the condom, which leads to breakage.

Third, even if you succeed, as simon's.donut noted, the condom probably won't be positioned properly. As the penis straightens and elongates, it will push the condom differentially, creating twists and stress points and tending to pull the base of the condom forward on the shaft.  This reduces the amount of the shaft protected against infection and increases the chance that the condom will come off.

Finally, it's important to have an empty space at the end of the condom to provide room for the semen.  This is why you are supposed to pinch the end of a condom before rolling it onto an erection.  But if you put the condom on a flaccid penis, the erection process will usually push the head of the penis forward until it fills that space, leading once again to increased risk of breakage.

**HOW TO DO IT RIGHT:**

With all these reasons *not* to put a condom on a soft penis, it's still sometimes necessary to do it.  Typically this happens when a man has erection problems and his partner is trying to use oral sex to get him hard while still avoiding the risk of STDs.  So:

 1. Pinch and fold over an extra large semen pocket at the tip of the condom. 
 2. Unroll the condom another inch, just enough for the head of the
    penis.
 3. Push the head of the soft penis into that space, making sure you
    don't trap any air inside.
 4. Have the man grip the head of the penis *very tightly* through the condom
    and pull hard away from his body, being careful not to pull the condom off
    or let the tip of the condom unfold.
 5. Roll the rest of the condom down the shaft, being careful to keep it
    straight and not to allow any air to get inside.
 6. Grip the ring at the base of the condom in one fist and keep that
    hand firmly in place until a full erection has been achieved.
 7. As the penis swells, check to be sure that there is still some slack
    at the tip; you may need to tug it upward a bit to be sure there is
    room for the ejaculate.

Okay, so it's doable, but as you can see it's *way* easier to do it right if the penis is hard.
