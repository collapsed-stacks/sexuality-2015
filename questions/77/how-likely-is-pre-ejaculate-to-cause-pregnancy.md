There are many conflicting sources from this topic, arguing that pre-ejaculate cannot get a woman pregnant while other saying just the opposite, that pregnancy is very likely to occur from pre-ejaculate. I can imagine it is _possible_ to get pregnant from pre-ejaculate, but is it _likely_? Are there any set of circumstances that that make pre-ejaculate more/less likely to cause pregnancy?

Spermatoza is present in pre-ejaculation.

Pre-ejaculation is just a way of our body to lubrificate for sexual intercourse.

But it comes from the same place as a normal ejaculation, therefore, there are always some spermatoza, even if in a smaller amount.

Which means that it is possible to cause pregnancy as much as ejaculation, since it's only one spermatoza needed to fecundate the egg.
