## What tests are possible to determine a non-obvious intersex condition?

Some people are born with a genotype (say, XX or XY) that typically expresses in a particular sexual phenotype (being female or male, respectively), but can sometimes, through various causes (e.g. presence of [an SRY gene][1] in an X chromosome, or [5Î±-Reductase deficiency][2]), cause either the opposite phenotype ([XX male][3] or XY female), or some other form of atypical physical sex (including ambiguous genitalia, etc.)

Collectively, these sorts of conditions are referred to as [Intersex][4] conditions, and some of these conditions are more obvious than others.

My question, then, is about the less obvious cases.  If someone seems to essentially be a typical male or female, yet perhaps has reasons to wonder about their chromosomal make-up and/or other Intersex factors (e.g. perhaps a male had [cryptorchidism][5] well past their first year of life, or a female has [a particularly large clitoris][6] or other "masculinized" characteristics), what testing could they get, and how could they acquire it, to find out if their chromosomal or hormonal state is outside the realm of "normal" for their designated sex?

Are there standard tests that any doctor could do?  Are there specialists that one could see?  How could one go about finding out which, if any, such conditions might apply to them, and thus have a better understanding of their own physiology?
