Aneros sex toys are prostate massagers and are advertised as having a range of sexual benefits (mostly related to prostate health). Here is their website:

https://www.aneros.com/

I have often heard that various sexual actions with the prostate can be beneficial, but prostate massage such as what's done with the Aneros is pretty extreme, and one has to wonder if such extreme stimulation of the prostate could have negative health consequences. 

I'm wondering if there are any clinical studies on the effect of prostate message on long-term prostate health, particularly studies related to Aneros and similar products.

<p><a href="http://www.chronicprostatitis.com/prostate-massage/" rel="nofollow">Vigorous prostate stimulation</a> might not be beneficial, if not detrimental, in the presence of underlying conditions like prostatitis or prostate cancer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, vigorous prostatic massage may be very dangerous:</p>
  
  <p>If you have acute bacterial prostatitis it can result insepticemia (blood poisoning).
  If you have the beginnings of a carcinoma in your prostate, it could conceivably result in the cancer being disturbed, broken up and metastasizing(spreading) around your body.
  It can result in prostatic calculi (little stones, if you have them) tearing the delicate membranes in the prostate, exacerbating your CP/CPPS.
  There is a chance of perforation of the very thin rectal lining adjacent to the prostate, or tearing the rectal lining with a fingernail or implement.
  It may cause a hemorrhoid flare-up.</p>
