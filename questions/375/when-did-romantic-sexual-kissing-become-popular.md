Today an article on [NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/08/12/431664215/not-everybody-likes-kissing) discusses the fact that a minority of cultures world-wide engage in what it calls "romantic-sexual" mouth-to-mouth kissing (defined as "lip-to-lip contact that may or may not be prolonged").  Apparently a large portion of cultures consider the practice to be disgusting and unsanitary.

I'm curious if any information is known about when this practice became popular, and perhaps where.
