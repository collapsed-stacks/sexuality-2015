Obviously, unprotected anal intercourse can transmit a variety of STDs, but let us assume for now that there is no such risk because either a condom has been used appropriately, or clean toys are being used.

What health risks does anal intercourse pose? How likely is it that the rectum is being damaged, and how grave is such a damage? How do I prevent such damage? Is it possible to feel the strain just before the damage? Are there any other risks than physical injury?
