Generally, alcohol impairs our judgement, makes us overestimate our abilities etc.

Does it also affect a person's sexual performance? For instance, does it affect his/hers ability to reach orgasm?

<p>The answer to this question differs quite a bit for men and women. </p>

<p><strong>For men</strong> the effect is quite immediate, reducing bloodflow to the penis. Men, on average, have more difficulty sustaining an erection the more alcohol is consumed. Orgasm is also affected:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Increasing levels of alcohol intoxication, as measured by
  blood‐alcohol concentration, produced significant degradation in male
  masturbatory effectiveness. Employing psychophysiological indices of
  orgasm and several subjective criteria, a progressive and systematic
  effect of alcohol on the orgasmic‐ejaculatory response was found.</p>

<p><strong>For women</strong> it seems to be more complicated. Blood flow is decreased, similar to what happens in men, and orgasms have lower subjective intensity, but (at least in the following study) a greater pleasure was derived from it. I'm not sure if you include that in your definition of performance, if you do not the answer is roughly identical for men and women.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(...) 18 university women were sustained at four different blood alcohol
  concentrations (...). Measures of vaginal blood volume (...)
  showed a progressive and systematic depressant effect of alcohol on
  orgasmic responding.</p>
  
  <p>Higher [blood alcohol concentrations] were associated with longer orgasmic latencies and
  decreased subjective intensity of orgasm, while, paradoxically, women
  reported significantly greater sexual arousal and orgasmic
  pleasurability under conditions of moderate and high alcohol
  intoxication.</p>
