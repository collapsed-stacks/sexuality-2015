My female partner and I have sex fairly often but I never manage to get her to orgasm. She said she doesn't mind to much but I would like to get her to orgasm anyways.

So how do I do that?

I believe the most important aspect of this is **communication**.

As there is now "one size fits all" answer to a question like this, so I would say you are best off asking what your partner likes or enjoys. While asserting vaginal simulation to be a most common solution, some women would prefer clitoral, anal, or breast stimulation. When you enter the realm of fetishes, this list would get too long and would be on a case-by-case basis.

If your partner is unaware of what they like, you can either experiment _with their permission_ or ask them to experiment on their own at their own pace. If they agree to experiment with you, then you should be very receptive to their reactions as it is their body and only they can tell you what feels good to them.

In short, **_it is better to ask than to assume_** as that will more often than not give you the best answer.

First of all there is no method that works for every woman. I can only give some advice that has worked for me.

To achieve a female orgasm you have to keep in mind that it takes far more than to achive a male orgasm.  
There are a lot of things you have to make right:

1. The setting:  
If you want a female to reach her orgasm you have to make sure she feels good. Don't just start of with her vagina. Start slowly teasing her around her body. (Just play around and you will learn what your partner likes) Just don't be too fast.
2. The stimulation:  
When she is aroused first of all make sure her vagina is wet. If not make it wet with salvia or lubricants.  
 + Start by rubbing the vagina focusing mainly on the clitoris but making sure not to apply to much pressure. After some time you can start fingering her but make sure to not use too many fingers. If you don't know how much is too much gradually increase the amount of fingers and ask if it is ok. When you are fingering her don't forget to keep rubbing the clitoris. This will help a lot reaching the orgasm.  
 + When you want her to reach orgasm with your penis make sure to also rub her clitoris.  
 + If you want her to reach orgasm through cunnilingus (eating her out) make sure to not to try to penetrate her vagina with your toungue and focus again on the clitoris bit make sure to not only stay there but instead to cover her whole vagina.  
You could also try to finger her while doing the above.

Try different things and make sure she enjoys what you are doing (watch her reactions or ask her (afterwards)).

Since there is no 100% fool proof method. Keep practicing and some day you might get her to reach a orgasm.
