My partner and I occasionally watch a raunchy film together in which the performer(s) usually unload a large amount of semen. We usually joke about the amount of water they must've had that day, or how 'it must've been a while', that sort of thing. 

However, I'm wondering if there's anything I could be doing to maximise the amount of semen I generate, as both my partner and I like the idea of a 'large load'. Currently I'm more like a water pistol than a super-soaker, if that makes sense.

I eat fairly healthily and exercise occasionally (probably less than I should), and I also abstain sometimes to 'build up' some semen, but are there any vitamins or supplements I could/should be taking, or anything else I'm missing that would increase my volume?

<p>Interestingly, it seems to be tapering off in the end (which makes sense, the testicles are only so big after all).  It'd be interesting to see when waiting no longer increases the volume. </p>

<p>I will note that this paper is kind of old (1979) but I don't think that this is likely to have changed in the last 36 years.  The results are consistent with those of <a href="http://www.zol.be/internet/uploadedfiles/fertility/links/presentaties/apotos.pdf">this 2004 paper</a>, but I prefer the older one since this one had a far smaller sample size of 11 (out of 16, because 5 men "did not strictly comply with abstinence criteria").</p>

<p>I will also note that semen volume <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2605.1982.tb00255.x/abstract">seems to not be related to chance of prenancy</a> (paper behind paywall, but relevant result is in the abstract). </p>
