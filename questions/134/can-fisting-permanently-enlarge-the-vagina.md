Many resources and books recommend fisting a vagina if both partners want it. But some people (such as comments found [here](http://www.dodsonandross.com/forum/topics/can-large-dildoes-cause-permanenet-vaginal-stretching)) warn that fisting can lead to permanent enlargement of the vagina, even after PC exercises, even to the extent that the woman may have to change the ways to reach climax.

I would like a definitive answer if this enlargement can or cannot stay for months or years. Please assume that the the deep end of the vagina was excited during foreplay, that the fingers were added very progressively, that the women did not have nor pain neither willingness to stop (e.g., excitation on the rest of the body was present), and that serious [lubrification](http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/q/80/201) has taken place.

Technically, it is possible to cause permanent damage to the vagina from fisting. However, it is not a problem of stretching as it is a matter of muscle control. The vagina isn't just a flab of skin or issue, it's a big, powerful muscle. Like all muscles, it gets stronger when exercised regularly, weaker if it's not exercised regularly, can be "trained" like other muscles, and can be damaged.

If damaged from extreme abuse (including possibly child birth), the vagina may never be able to contract as tight as it used to. This can lead to the sensation referred to as being "stretched out." In all other cases, exercise can restore it back to its normal size over time. Generally speaking, with proper care and exercise, there's no reason why a vagina that is fisted regularly will not eventually reach normal size after a period of inactivity. The same thing occurs after a period of sexual inactivity, where it takes significant more lube/patience/effort to have intercourse after taking a break for a few months.

Assuming no pain was involved in the fisting, and the vagina is youthful enough to recover, the vagina should eventually bounce back to its smaller self. Age is an important factor, as it will take longer to recover the older the person is and the longer they've been practicing fisting. In the case of older people, you may as well consider the effect permanent. There's no exact age limit when the effect can't be easily reversed (depends on genes, health, etc), but probably lies between the late twenties to early forties.
