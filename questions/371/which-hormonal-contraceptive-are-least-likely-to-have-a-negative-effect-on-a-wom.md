If a woman starts taking the pill and experiences reduced libido, one often sees the advice that she should switch to another brand or type of contraceptive.  But is this side-effect more common with some than with others?

Generally speaking, the lower the dose of hormones, the lower the incidence and severity of side effects. For this reason I'd recommend Mirena or Implanon, which are more effective than pills while requiring much lower levels of hormones in the body.
