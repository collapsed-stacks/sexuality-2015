The word *vanilla* is often used in a sexual context, to describe either practices or people’s tastes (or, sometimes, the people themselves). What does this mean?

##Summary

*Vanilla* sexual tastes are “conventional” or “ordinary”, by contrast to [BDSM (Bondage, Bondage & Discipline, Dominance & Submission and Sado-Masochism)](http://h2g2.com/approved_entry/A14168621).

Of course, people can have different ideas about what counts as “ordinary”, but the term was invented in contrast to BDSM, so *vanilla* basically means “non-BDSM” and perhaps also “non-fetish” (language can be slippery, and pinning down definitions is tricky).

That’s the full answer, really, but if you want some of the history of the word, read on.

##Linguistic Background

The [Online Etymology Dictionary](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vanilla) has this to say about *vanilla*:

> 1660s, “pod of the vanilla plant,” from Spanish *vainilla* “vanilla plant,” literally “little pod,” diminutive of *vaina* “sheath,” from Latin *vagina* “sheath of an ear of grain, hull of a plant” (see *[vagina](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vagina)*). So called from the shape of the pods. European discovery 1521 by Hernando Cortes’ soldiers on reconnaissance in southeastern Mexico. Meaning “flavoring extracted from the vanilla bean” is attested by 1728. Meaning “conventional, of ordinary sexual preferences” is 1970s, from notion of whiteness and the common choice of vanilla ice cream.

Etymological dictionaries tend to work in reverse chronological order, as they describe where words *come* from. So let’s recast this. A Latin word for a sheath, scabbard, or the hull of a plant was inherited into Spanish, where a diminutive (“little pod”) was applied to a certain plant. That plant name came into English where the meaning was expanded to include the flavouring extracted from the beans of the plant.

As this flavouring was the default in ice-cream, it was expanded metaphorically to refer to “conventional” or “ordinary” sexual preferences (i.e., non-BDSM).

From there, the term has expanded to various other meanings of conventional, default, or ordinary. In technological circles, for example, *vanilla* means “default, unmodified, standard”. When specifically applied to gaming, for example, it means the default game, without any add-ons.

This use of *vanilla* to mean “ordinary” is found in all sorts of contexts, but *in my personal experience* the two most prevalent contexts are the original (sex) and technology.

##Etymological Sidenote

Incidentally, the word *vanilla* is etymologically related to *vagina*, but the derivation is completely unrelated to this usage. [They developed independently](http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=738). (*Vagina* was deliberately coined in English from the Latin word for “sheath”; the word was never used in this sense in Latin itself, and has nothing to do with the completely separate derivation of *vanilla* by way of Spanish seed pods.)
