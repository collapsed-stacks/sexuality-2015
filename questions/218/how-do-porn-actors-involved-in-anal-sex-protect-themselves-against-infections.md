According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum):

>The rectum acts as a temporary storage site for feces

And anal intercourse means inserting the penis into this very "temporary storage site for feces".

While enema can make the rectum *appear* clean and prevent any visible trace of feces during the anal intercourse, I am pretty sure that ordinary enema, based on water, can't possibly elliminiate all the [coliforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_coliform) that resides in the rectum.

Using a condom makes this a non-issue since one just takes it off and throw it away later. However, it is quite common in the porn industry to perform anal sex without a condom, and on regular basis. As far as I can tell, that's a huge health risk so my question is, how the porn actors involved in this kind of sexual activity protect themselves against infections? Is there any kind of preventive treatment?

<p>So colliform bacteria causes <a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0401/p583.html" rel="nofollow">Epididymitis</a>, which is a sexually transmitted testicular infection that can be cleared up with antibiotics (specifically ofloxacin or levofloxacin). </p>

<p>You <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/testicle_infection_epididymitis/page8_em.htm" rel="nofollow">prevent epididymitis</a> by abstinence, condom usage, and hygiene. The mumps vaccine usage is typically preventative for prepubescent boys, since mumps can take hold in their testicles. Since porn actors are not practicing abstinence, and in some cases not using condoms, hygiene is the only way to combat the infection. Washing the genital area and urinating after sex are helpful in preventing infection, but condom usage and abstinence are more effective.</p>

*There is no preventative care in the amateur pornography business; there are just regular health check-ups.* 

Condom use in male-male and male-female pornography
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Homosexual and heterosexual male pornographic videos do have a problem with condom use insofar that they have received negative attention and concern from the press, the scientific community, and public health workers.

Grudzen's paper "Condom use and high-risk sexual acts in adult films: a comparison of heterosexual and homosexual films," has been questioned by Silvera, et al., for not being comprehensive enough.<sup>1</sup> This is their reason:

> because the viewing of unprotected sex by MSM may lead to a
> community-wide impression that **unprotected sexual practices are the**
> **norm**. **This perception may cause an increase in the frequency of**
> **unprotected sexual practices and thus increase the risk of acquisition**
> **and transmission of HIV, HIV superinfection, and other sexually**
> **transmitted infections**

*Because so many people have seen pornography without condoms, the authors seem to conclude that condom-less sex in pornography is ubiquitous, normal, and acceptable. This may hint that most or many pornographic videos are without condoms, which support that there is no preventative care in the amateur pornography business.* 

The underlying reason for the avoidance of using condoms, in Bangladesh, may be connected with "social dimensions of masculine sexuality, pleasure, eroticism and the emotional aspect of men’s lives." <sup>2</sup> In addition,

> **Sexual prowess in the form of prolonged intercourse without condoms,**
> **as depicted in Western pornography**, was perceived as a ‘real man’s’
> sexual skill. Men sought to preserve a ‘good man’s’ image by avoiding
> condoms, which symbolised promiscuous men in AIDS educational
> messages. <sup>2</sup>

*Western pornography is laden with images of condom-less sex. Sexual intercourse without condoms is a form of sexual prowess of a "real man" or a "good man," presumably free of AIDS and other venereal diseases.* 

"Healthcare" in Hot Girls Wanted (2015) documentary
---------------------------------------

In the Hot Girls Wanted (2015) documentary, a group of young adult girls is recruited to Florida to work in the amateur porn industry. Why Florida? Because Florida does not ban pornography made without condoms. One of the girls develops a cyst for producing too much natural lubricant due to having too much sex in a day, and she becomes hospitalized. When she recovers, she has to pay her own medical bill with her own money, presumably paid for by her income. It seems that the amateur porn industry does not have a retirement plan or a medical coverage plan for its workers. That same girl also reveals her occupation as a porn actress to her mother, and her mother immediately expresses concern for her, asking the daughter whether she uses contraceptives. *The girl reports that she does not, but she does use regular medical check-ups. It is through this documentary that I've become aware that not only are there no condoms in many pornographies, but also the porn stars have to pay for their medical bills.*
