<p>While there isn't a strict, predefined limit for the amount of sex that any one person can have, your body does have its own limits. As an example, the documentary <em>Hot Girl Wanted</em> shows one of the female pornstars being afflicted with Bartholin's Cyst. The reason was because the glands that kept the vagina moist became clogged, resulting in the aforementioned disease. These pornstars have sex on a daily basis, with sexual encounters lasting more than your average person. So while this is an extreme example, there is such a thing as too much sex.</p>

<p>Another problem that women might encounter by having too much sex is <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/honeymoon-cystitis">Urinary Tract Infection.</a> As stated in the article, this can occur when the bacteria that resides in the vagina gets pushed up into the bladder, causing an infection.</p>

<p>As for men, some signs that shows when's <a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/health/how-much-sex-is-too-much-sex-20140531">enough is enough is how sore your penis is</a>. Also, usually an erection will subside when your body is exhausted, making it extremely difficult to continue having sex. Finally, and this is something that may apply to women as well, there may be some psychological impact from frequent sex. Excessive sex may indicate hypersexuality and reinforces it, although research on this is still ongoing.</p>

<p>We must also consider that there <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Sex/sex-related-injuries-common/story?id=10637541">are common sex-related injuries</a> and having frequent sex would of course, increase the chance of it happening. These injuries include broken bones and penile fractures.</p>
