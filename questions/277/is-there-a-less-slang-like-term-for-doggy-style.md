Like the title states, I'm wondering if there is a more official wording to describe 'doggy-style' - the position of intercourse where one partner is on elbows and knees whilst the other partner enters from behind.

<p>It seems that a synonym is actually hard to find, though not impossible.</p>

<p>You can find a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggy_style" rel="nofollow">here</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> It is described in the Kama Sutra as the cow position or the congress of a cow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Latin it is known as <em>Coitus more ferarum</em>, or <em>"sexual intercourse in the manner of wild beasts"</em>.</p>

<p>You may also use other terms which describe modified versions of the doggy-style, like leapfrog style or froggy style.</p>
