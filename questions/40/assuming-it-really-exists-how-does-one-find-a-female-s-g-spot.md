What can I do to find it?

<p>Your partner may not have an area she would experience as a 'G-Spot'. There have been tons of studies on the subject, and it's hard to say what and where it is - as it's a type of moving target when claims against its existence are put forth. Among current candidates for the G-for-Gräfenberg-spot are: an extension of the clitoris, a part of the female prostate - aka <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Skenes_gland.jpg/250px-Skenes_gland.jpg">Skene's gland</a>, or just a collection of sensitive tissue.</p>

<p>However, even if there <em>is</em> such an area anatomically (however hard to find), then there is no specific reason why your partner would perceive it as a 'special' area. Under questionnaires many women report not ever feeling it at all, so you digging around looking for long-lost treasure may not be a welcome event. You'd be better off giving her a good orgasm, without worrying about physicians with funny names.</p>

<p>That being said, if you want a map marked <strong>X</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is typically reported to be located 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) up the
  front (anterior) vaginal wall between the vaginal opening and the
  urethra</p>
</blockquote>
