I believe anal sex exists for almost as long as ordinary sex, but wonder what is the first recorded evidence for it, as in something describing/telling about anal sex that predates most years back?

For the sake of this question, it doesn't matter if it is between male and female, or male and male - just curious about that specific form of sex.

The image above is a rendering of a detail from a prehistoric carving. It shows a couple having sex from behind while standing. It [has been suggested](https://www.academia.edu/1492278/The_Subversive_Male_homosexual_and_bestial_images_on_European_Mesolithic_rock-art) that the couple are both men, both in any case, the angle of the penis appears to suggest anal sex.

#So the oldest *possible* description of anal sex (the carving from the Cavern d'Enlene) dates back 14,500 years, but the oldest *definite* description (the Pyramid Texts) dates back 4,300 - 4,400 years.

Images aren't always clear about the distinction between doggie-style and anal, but there are 4000-yr-old Babylonian plaques that show rear entry, and the Babylonians left records that describe anal sex as a popular contraceptive method.
