Chinese Emperors usually had [thousands of wives and concubines][1], and often went on to father dozens and dozens of sons and daughters.

Where did they get the energy to maintain their hyperactive sexual activities?

<p>A quote from the cited article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some emperors believed they could gain immortality form having sex with as many women as possible but <strong>never ejaculating.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to ejaculate is a very common practice to prolong sexual arousal. When you don't ejaculate you can have an erection for many hours, and in this time you can have sex with many different partners.</p>

<p>When you practice tantric sex (the syllable “tan” in “tantra” means “stretch, extend, expand”), then you prolong your arousal by holding still just before you get an orgasm to avoid the orgasm, and this is what those emperors might have done.</p>

<p>When a man does so, and has, let's say 10 hours of sex every day, and spends only 5 minutes for each partner, then he has sex in just one day with 120 people.</p>

<p>Just to give an other number: At Oct 12 2004 the porn-actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Sparks" rel="nofollow">Lisa Sparxxx</a> was penetrated by 919 different men in just one day. At this day she didn't just win the Third Annual World Gangbang Championship, since this day she also is holding the world record of having sex with the most partners within one day. And if you count a singe penetration (insertion of penis into the vagina) as sexual act, then also men are able to have sex with about 1000 women within a single day - if they don't ejaculate.</p>

<p>But even if you don't ejaculate during many hours, there will be the moment at the end of the day when you will. And when you have those gang-bang-parties only every third day, and only every fifth women will get pregnant from you, then you still will fertilize a woman every two weeks, which will result in 25 children every year! </p>

<p>When you have sex on each third day with 50 partners per day, then, at the end, you will have had sex with approximately 6000 partners within only one year, or almost 200,000 partners during 30 years, and you will have fathered 750 children.</p>

<p>And, there is another thing that you have to consider: Not everything that was written about emperors is really absolutely true. “Thousand” can just mean “very much”.</p>
