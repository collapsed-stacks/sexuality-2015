I've never had one broken, but sometimes it worries me (I wouldn't want a pregnancy right now). Can a man feel a condom breaking during intercourse?

Yes you can, but not always. It depends on the condom and how it fits. When a tighter condom breaks you are more likely to notice than one that's more of a skin feel. All condoms deaden the sensation somewhat, so sudden change of feel is your best indication. Basically, if it starts to feel really good all of a sudden you should check.

As GdD says, sometimes it's really obvious, other times it's not. Sometimes you may not feel it at all.

This has happened to me personally twice:

- The first time my partner felt it snap, I didn't feel anything, 
- The second time I felt the increased sensation and she didn't notice. 

Both times we made sure to get emergency contraception (the Morning-After Pill) afterward.

In terms of minimising the risk of this occurring:

- Remember not to stretch it too tightly over your penis,
- Use lubrication, and make sure it's **water based** - check the bottle before purchasing
- If you're ever not 100% sure, pull out and check.

Adding to the existing answers my own (sad) experience, if it breaks during ejaculation, you can't really feel that. Shortly before ejaculating I felt something wrong so pulled out to check, and the condom was fine, so I kept going. However when pulling out after my climax, it was empty and I could see the hole.

This probably means I pushed too hard and/or the condom was weak to begin with, so my conclusions are:

- Replace the condom on the first suspicion, even if it appears fine
- Try to not push too hard even during orgasm

Worked for me, no accidents since then.
