Do women need to feel loved in order to achieve orgasms?

My partner said that women need to feel loved in order to achieve orgasms, but I also read that vibrators can help women reach orgasms. 

So, can a woman reach orgasms when having sex without someone she doesn't love?

<p>This is not true.</p>

<p>Women can <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201102/vibrators-myths-vs-truth">definitely</a> achieve orgasms using vibrators and other sex toys.  Sadly it is actually possible for women (and men) <a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-05/science-arousal-during-rape">being raped</a> to experience orgasms, and that is as far from love as you can get.</p>

<p>However this does not imply that all woman can orgasm without love.  Everyone is different, and it is certainly possible for your partner to need an emotional connection to orgasm.  In fact, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/11/i-dont-feel-sexually-attr_n_6141226.html">some claim</a> to not be able to feel any sexual arousal without a pre-existing emotional bond.  </p>

Women and men are different in the way that they feel arousal and in how they arrive at an orgasm.

Most women require to be in the correct mental state to be aroused and then to orgasm, whereas for men physical contact is often enough to arouse them. It is true that physical contact alone can cause arousal and orgasm in women as referenced in Sciencertobe's answer.

What your partner is most likely referring to is woman's need for foreplay. This is to get them relaxed, focused on the sexual act, allow them to let go of their mind and feel their body. Most women can't orgasm without sufficient foreplay and arousal as for them the orgasm is more about their mental state, than physical.

Whereas most men can jump right into the act without a worry in the world.
