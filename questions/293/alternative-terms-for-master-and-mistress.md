In my native language (German) I know quite a few terms for both the male and the female top in BDSM. But what other names and terms can be used in English?

I am also wondering if there are any common terms for BDSM tops with a non-binary gender.

According to [this](http://www.evilmonk.org/a/terms.cfm#domme):

>Dominant (or Dom)  
>
>1. (adj.) Exercising the most influence or control; governing. (American Heritage Dictionary)  
2. (adj.) Most prominent in position or prevalence; ascendant. (American Heritage Dictionary)  
3. (n.) In the scene, a person that enjoys assuming control, dominating others, and taking the active roll in making most -- or all -- of the decisions in a scene or in relationships with a submissive or bottom. (Compare with "top.")

And also:

>Domme, Domina, Dominatrix  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n.) A dominant who is female.

The term "Dominant" appears solid, as also can be seen [here](http://www.asubmissivesjourney.com/dom2.html) and applies to both genders.

"Domme" and  "Domina" also appear valid and widely used, Dominatrix even got a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominatrix) - interesting enough, can't find male equivalent term.
