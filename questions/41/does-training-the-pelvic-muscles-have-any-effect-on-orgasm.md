Somewhere in the heyday of phpBB there was an older man on a forum I was part of who explained that he did pelvic muscle exercises (like holding your pee) to increase the pleasure derived from orgasm (something to do with contractions). A woman (~30s) chimed in, she also did them and said it really worked out for her. I've come to know they are also called Kegel exercises, and pregnant women perform similar exercises to train muscles required for childbirth.

Do these exercises have any effect? I'm interested for both men and women.

The simple answer is yes they do help.

For a man:
Increased control over when an orgasm takes place, these pelvic floor muscles are the ones that contract during an orgasm to make the male ejaculate. If you have a greater control over these muscles, then you have more control over your ejaculations. For example an ejaculation cannot occur when these muscles are relaxed. One could also use these muscles to move their penis during sex which could end up in increased pleasure for both partners.

For women:
These muscles line the wall of the vagina and are directly involved in the woman's orgasm. The stronger these muscles, the more intense your orgasm, as these are the muscles that contract during orgasm. These muscles also decrease the size of the vagina when contracted (i.e. this allows you to squeeze and hold onto an object inside your vagina). Greater control and strength of these muscles allow one to increase the pleasure for both partners by tightening the vagina and increasing friction.

They are very simple exercises, and can be done while sitting at your desk or on the bus or anywhere really (and no-one will notice). Continued training will result in increasing benefits, and don't expect any changes to happen overnight (like with any muscles).

Doing Kegels will improve your sex life and other things too.  Better PC muscle tone helps prevent incontinence, makes childbirth easier and reduces perineal tearing, and increases vaginal "snugness" during normal intercourse, which makes sex more fun for both parties.  It also lets you do fun things like having "kegel contests." (E.g., the man does several kegels in a row, which makes the penis flip upward inside the vagina, and the woman responds by clamping down hard and gripping the penis the same number of times.  Or vice versa.)

Kegels are a great boon to men who have PE or who just want to last longer in bed.  They are also the key for men who want to learn how to have non-ejaculatory orgasms, letting them have multiple orgasms without losing their erections.

So do your Kegels every day!  Male or female, you'll be glad you did!
