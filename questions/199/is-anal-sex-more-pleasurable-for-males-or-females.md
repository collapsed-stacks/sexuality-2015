<p>It depends? I believe both sexes can enjoy anal sex equally. </p>

<p>In male-bodied individuals, anal sex can stimulate the prostate, which can be very pleasurable or very intense (again, it depends). </p>

<p>In female-bodied indivduals, anal sex can stimulate the vaginal walls, seeing as they are right next to each other. And, women who participate in anal sex <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02020.x/abstract">have more orgasms (Table 5, page 357)</a>. Not to say that causation and correlation are the same, but it seems that many women do enjoy anal. A lot.</p>

<p>In both sexes, there are plenty of nerve endings in the anal area. In a sexual context, stimulating them can be very enjoyable.</p>

I don't think there is ever going to be a way to answer that objectively.  I've talked to women who rave about anal.  There's anecdotal and web-survey evidence that orgasms are more likely to happen among women who like anal a lot, but no way to tell which way causality runs.  But in my interviews with long-term couples, only a quarter of the women like full anal penetration, and that seems to be fairly typical of other surveys that screen out the cases of "I tried it once and it hurt like crazy, so never again!"

One thing I've noticed is that women who rave about anal orgasms are almost never doing **just** anal penetration.  The sessions they describe usually begin with extensive clitoral, vaginal, and anal stimulation, frequently including multiple orgasms, before penile penetration of the anus begins.  In most cases, the clitoral stimulation also continues *during* the anal penetration.  

For example, a friend of mine starts with a series of orgasms from oral and manual stimulation of her clit, labia, vaginal opening, and anus by her generous and talented husband.  When she's ready for the big finale, she lies face down with a thick cushion under her hips and the head of a "Magic Wand" vibrator between her clit and the cushion. Her husband slowly inserts his penis in her anus and then strokes to completion while she grinds her vulva on the vibrator.  This generally triggers a sustained rapid-fire series of orgasms for her that starts as soon as he enters her, lasts until he finishes, and is longer and more intense than what she can get from any other kind of sex.

I know a lot of men love doing penetrative anal, and some really like being the receiver.  Even more like being fingered and receiving prostate massage.  Some describe the latter, in particular, in language that sounds as ecstatic as the language some women use when they are super-enthusiastic about anal or anal/clitoral orgasms. But, as with most things sexual, men describe a shorter period of peak pleasure than women do, and lab studies seem to confirm that.

I don't think there's any way we'll ever prove which gender has more pleasure from any kind of sex.  However, my completely unprovable hunch is that the same two rules apply to anal as to most kinds of sex:  On the average, women enjoy it less, just because bad sex is bad for women and mostly okay for men.  On the other hand, at the extreme of greatest pleasure, women enjoy great sex more, or at least enjoy it just as much for much longer.
