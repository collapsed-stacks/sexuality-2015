<li>Carefully open the packet. Do not cut or shred the packet. You may put holes in the condom!</li>
<li>Orient the condom carefully, and do not unroll it. It should look like a <strong><a href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/2/1378120614794/Condom-006.jpg" rel="nofollow">little sombrero.</a></strong> If it looks like <strong><a href="http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/wrong-way-condom-7.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a></strong>, it won't unroll properly. Poke the tip through the ring gently. </li>
<li>Pinch the tip of the condom. Make sure you have a fully erect penis. This will make putting the condom on much easier, and will lower your chances of making a mistake.</li>
<li>Place your correctly-oriented condom onto your penis. Begin gently unrolling it. If it resists unrolling, you've probably done it incorrectly. If you've oriented it wrong, toss the condom and get a new one. If you touch one side of the condom to your penis and then use that side to penetrate your partner, you've defeated the purpose of the condom! Start over.</li>
<li>Roll the condom all the way down your shaft.</li>
<li>Check the condom periodically for breaks and slipping. If something feels wrong, it doesn't hurt to check things out. </li>
<li>Use a water-based or silicone lube over the condom if needed. Do not use oil based lubes, they will break down the condom (similar to peanut butter and chewing gum). </li>
</ol>

<p>Immediately after ejaculating, withdraw from your partner, grasping the base of the condom. Otherwise, sperm may leak out of the condom, and you'll need to act as if you had never worn one in the first place (contraception, STD testing, etc.)! Slide it off your penis away from them. Tie the open end off in a knot and toss it in the trash.</p>
