My partner and I have observed vaginal farts multiple times during the intercourse and the intensity varies with the positions we try. e.g. with doggy the intensity is on a higher side and with variations of missionary it is almost negligible. One other thing we noted that it does not happen on a regular basis but then there are days when the farts become louder than our moans.

The question: What are vaginal farts and are they related to sexual health in any manner?

<p>The common term for this is "queef" or "queefing." It's caused by an air trap effect that is very idiosyncratic, depending on the size and shape of that particular penis, the size and shape of the opening of that particular vagina, and the geometry and type of movement that determine how the two interact in a particular position.</p>

<p>Basically, something about the motion and shape of the penis pushes air into the vagina and traps it there on the outstroke.  When the pressure is too high, or the position changes, some or all of the air escapes.  Since it's caused by the interaction, not just one person, it's correct to say that <em>the couple</em> queefed when it happens.</p>

<p>Things I've observed from conversations about this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some women have never (or almost never) experienced a queef.</li>
<li>Some women queef with most partners.</li>
<li>Some men have never (or almost never) experienced a queef.</li>
<li>Some men queef with most partners.</li>
<li>Some couples never queef, even though both parties have queefed with others.</li>
<li>Some couples queef a lot, even though neither party queefed with others.</li>
<li>Some couples queef a lot in one or two positions and not in others.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is all anecdotal - I don't know of any serious research on the subject, sorry.  But I'm willing to bet that it has nothing to do with sexual health. As  Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale Medical School says, â€œQueefing is of zero health consequence."

<p>On the other hand, it's a sign of a healthy sexual and personal relationship when neither person is embarrassed about it!</p>
