First of all a little background: during my life I have been with several girls who started taking the contraceptive pill (the "1 pill per day"-solution) just as a contraceptive mean, since no one of them had clinical problem with their menstruation-cycle.  
*All* of them, though, had this annoying collateral effect, which made them less-to-none interested in having a "healthy" frequency of intercourses.  
Of course all the medics who examinated them before prescribing the pill always sponsored the current one to be with less hormones than its predecessor, chemically "better" made and blah blah...

The fact is that even after 15 years things have not changed: nowadays I find myself in the very situation, where after starting taking the pill, my girlfriend said to me "I feel I have no desire to have sex". Is there a biological explanation to that? How can we avoid this problem?

A quick reality check: [significant libido drops are uncommon](http://www.m.webmd.com/women/features/the-pill-and-desire) as a consequence of the birth control pill, and it's a little unusual that you'd encounter it quite this often. 

> Researchers looked at 33 years of studies that included more than 8,400 women taking birth control pills. Of those women, 22% reported a rise in their libido, 15% said they felt less desire, and 63% reported no change at all. (ibid.)

Typically, only around 1% of individuals felt it was significant enough to report to their physician/gynaecologist. 

The first place to look is in lifestyle. Predominantly, have there been any recent changes in your lives which could cause undue stress, drain energy, or otherwise sap libido? If so, that's the first place to investigate.

However, this is all a little beside the point. If you're sure it's the pill interfering, then talking to a doctor or professional sex therapist is the best approach. Ultimately, though, your options are either to live with existing birth control methods, or change which method(s) you're using.
