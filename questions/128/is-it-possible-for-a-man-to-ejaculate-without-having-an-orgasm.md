It has happened to me that when I tried but failed to delay my orgasm (using a method like bending my penis to uncomfortable position) I ejaculated but somehow didn't feel the orgastic feelings.

Have you experienced such situation? 

Is it possible that I ejaculated without triggering an orgasm in my body?

I didn't continue in the intercourse, but if something like this happens again, will I be able to have another orgasm relatively soon, or will this "failed attempt" count as an actual orgasm in regards to achieving a new one?

There are a number of factors to consider here. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm#In_males), ejaculation without orgasm or even the sensation of sexual pleasure is indeed possible.

However, while there is no clear consensus about what constitutes an orgasm, I would argue that if you were close to orgasm already, what you experienced was simply an unusually weak orgasm, perhaps overshadowed by the uncomfortable sensations you induced to prevent it.

It is not uncommon, when edging, to experience several "mini-orgasms", possibly in quick succession. From my personal experience, it is possible to reach a "full" or more powerful orgasm shortly thereafter, but the same might not be true for you.

Orgasm and ejaculation are two separate events. It's possible to orgasm without ejaculating, for example using tantric techniques tensing up the pelvic muscle. The sensation isn't entirely the same, so one could say it's a different kind of orgasm. Also if the prostate is empty it's still possible to have orgasmic feelings with little or no ejaculation.

It's also possible to ejaculate without orgasm (as in orgasm meaning the whole drug-like effect caused by dopamine and other neuro transmitters affecting your state of mind). The simplest way to test this is to stimulate the penis close to orgasm, and when you are just at the 'point of no return' stop stimulation. Ejaculation (with or without muscular contractions) will take place but without pleasurable feelings. In the BDSM culture this is considered frustrating experience for the man and is called a "ruined orgasm".

Further more it is possible to stimulate the prostate directly in order to create an "ejaculation". This can for some people cause orgasmic feelings, but in general does not.

How you are able to follow up afterwards, will probably differ from person to person. I would say give it a try and find out. In my case sexual arousal stays, and I can reach an orgasm quite briefly afterwards.

<p>If, by "having an orgasm," we mean "experiencing a pronounced wave of pleasurable sensation associated with the release of sexual tension," then yes, it is definitely possible.  For example, prostate massage can be used to induce ejaculation in men with spinal injuries or penile neuropathy and "nocturnal emissions" may still occur in some men with these conditions without any feeling of "having an orgasm."</p>

<p>My source for this information was a long conversation with a doctor and several physical therapists who work with paraplegics, both men and women, to help them regain some orgasmic function.  The doctor also mentioned in passing that a man who has very low oxytocin production or sensitivity, such as from damage to the hypothalamus, may have emissions without any sense of orgasmic pleasure, but I'm not sure whether that was based on research or conjecture.</p>

<p>In addition, there are many conditions, like depression, trauma, drug use, and alcoholism that can cause such deep anhedonia that a man could experience the full sequence of events in the brain and body that show up in MRIs and on other instruments during orgasm and ejaculation, but without having any perception of pleasure. It's not clear whether that should be defined as "not having an orgasm" or "having an orgasm but not enjoying it." </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ejaculation that occurs without orgasm and without pleasure is called
  anhedonic ejaculation or anorgasmic ejaculation; orgasm that occurs
  without ejaculation (“dry orgasm”) is usually neurogenic or anatomical
  in etiology.  Orgasm and ejaculation may also occur out of sync — in
  such cases ejaculate dribbles out via gravity after orgasm versus
  pulsatile ejaculation occurring at the time of orgasm.</p>

It is known that men, who for a longer period of time didn't ejaculate, can wake up in the morning with a stain of semen in their pants. This is rare, but can happen during a nightly erection while sleeping, and happens without an orgasm. So, yes, ejaculation without an orgasm is possible.

I've written more about nightly erections in the context of what is called "morning wood" here: http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/questions/150/is-nocturnal-penile-tumescence-aka-morning-wood-result-of-sexual-arousal/216#216 in the paragraph titled *“wet” dreams*.
