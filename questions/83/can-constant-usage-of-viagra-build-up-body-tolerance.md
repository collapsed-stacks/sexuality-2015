If I am having erectile dysfunction that is caused by psychological issues, and a doctor prescribed me Viagra, should I be judicious when using it? Is it possible to develop a tolerance for it, so that it becomes less effective when over-used?

What does current medical evidence say?

<p>Regarding how judicious you ought to be in your use of Viagra, that is certainly something you should discuss with your doctor.</p>

<p>There is evidence of the capacity for Viagra users to develop a tolerance.  This tolerance was significant enough that folks raised their dosage or stopped using Viagra altogether.  One such study is published in the Journal of Urology, Volume 166, Issue 3 (Sep. 2001), titled "<a href="http://www.jurology.com/article/S0022-5347%2805%2965866-1/fulltext" rel="nofollow">LONG-TERM EFFICACY OF SILDENAFIL AND TACHYPHYLAXIS EFFECT.</a>"  </p>

<p>Here are some things you can do if you find yourself developing a tolerance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check with your doctor.</li>
<li>Make sure that Viagra targets your specific ED problem.</li>
<li>Make sure you are getting the actual drug.</li>
<li>Try one of Viagra’s competitors, Cialis or Levitra.</li>
<li>If you smoke, stop.</li>
<li>Don’t rush things.  Even folks without ED need time to become aroused.</li>
</ul>

<p>The common theme in all the above advice is to talk to your doctor, so please do follow up with him or her.</p>
