My understanding is that there are at least two STDs for which there is no cure, and against which condoms do not offer good protection:

 - HPV (human papillomavirus, of which there are scores of varieties)
 - Herpes simplex

In fact, it appears that there are not even reliable tests (i.e., having low false negative rates) available to determine whether a person is infected with these viruses.

Are there other countermeasures that can be used to avoid infection with these viruses?  Or do even the most informed just accept it as a hazard and decide that the consequences of infection aren't bad enough to deter their sexual behavior?

The best way to avoid all sexually transmitted diseases is to avoid all contact with bodily fluids from an infected person, including saliva, blood, semen, vaginal discharge, or anywhere else such infection might be present. In other words, complete abstinence is the only 100% risk-free solution. All sexual contact, including kissing, carries the risk of infection. A person can be infected and never know it. There's no test for HPV, and it could even have been transmitted from non-sex activities, such as child birth.

However, compared to some diseases, such as HIV, the mortality rate for both diseases in the question is significantly lower, even without treatment. That's not to say that any particular person might not die from it, it's simply not as guaranteed as with some more potent diseases.

There are steps that one can take to reduce the risk significantly, but never eliminate it, except as noted above. Avoid contact with people you don't know well, don't trust well, or are known to be high risk takers. If you haven't had the HPV vaccination, do get it, as it may very well save your life. Also, obviously, don't have sexual contact with anyone that has any symptoms or have ever been known to have symptoms. Prefer partners that prefer low risk individuals.

You shouldn't worry about HPV and HSV, in particular, compared to diseases with a higher mortality rate than these diseases. However, any contact with anyone may very well cause infection, so carefully consider each partner before doing anything at all.

Avoid parties with alcohol or drugs, which may impair judgement, if not your own than people known to frequent such parties. These are high risk environments.

That aside, it's obvious that despite the risks, humans continue to have sex. The only real preventive measure available for HSV is common sense, and aside from the HPV vaccination, this rule applies to HPV as well. People do continue to accept the risks, no matter how well informed. The future of the human race depends on it.

<p>Avoidance is basically the same as for any STD:  know your partner, avoid casual sex, practice monogamy, use protection, avoid contact with all bodily fluids and with people with open sores.  Apply the same restrictions to kissing and sharing food or utensils that you would apply to sex.   Wash your hands often and keep them away from your face. In short, behave like a germaphobe.</p>

<p>That sounds old-fashioned, boring, and restrictive, and it clearly is unacceptable to many people, which is why these viruses are endemic.</p>

<p>Oral herpes (HSV-1) is a very common, but relatively minor problem.  Genital herpes (HSV-2) is substantially more aggravating, but rarely life-threatening. HPV is a collection of ~100 viruses that are also common, and some of them can cause serious illnesses, including cancers of the cervix, penis, throat, tongue, anus, and related areas.</p>

<p>The big problem with both HPV and HSV, compared to more dangerous STDs like syphilis and HIV, is that condoms are of limited use in protecting against infection.  You can get them from kissing, oral sex, and even external contact with the area around the genitals, mouth, and anus.</p>

<p><strong>Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)</strong></p>

<p>The University of Maryland Medical Center has <a href="http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/herpes-simplex-virus#ixzz3hg4fgkkQ" rel="nofollow">a good summary on herpes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HSV-1 is the main cause of herpes infections on the mouth and lips,
  including cold sores and fever blisters. It is transmitted through
  kissing or sharing drinking glasses and utensils. HSV-1 can also cause
  genital herpes, although HSV-2 is the main cause of genital herpes.</p>
  
  <p>HSV-2 is spread through sexual contact. You may be infected with HSV-1
  or HSV-2 but not show any symptoms. Often symptoms are triggered by
  exposure to the sun, fever, menstruation, emotional stress, a weakened
  immune system, or an illness. There is no cure for herpes, and once
  you have it, it is likely to come back. However, some people may have
  one outbreak and then never have another one. In between herpes
  outbreaks, the virus lies dormant (as if it is hibernating or
  sleeping) in nerve cells.</p>
  
  <p>Exposure to HSV-1 is extremely common -- as many as 90% of American
  adults have been exposed to the virus -- and there is no stigma to
  having a cold sore.  However, HSV-2, or genital herpes, can cause
  embarrassment. Although there is no cure for genital herpes, an
  infected person can take steps to prevent spreading the disease and
  can continue to have a normal sex life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In spite of the names, HSV-1 can cause genital infections and HSV-2 can cause oral infections:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HSV-1 is spread through saliva. Kissing, using the same eating
  utensils, sharing personal items (such as a razor), and receiving oral
  sex from someone who has HSV-1 can cause you to contract the virus.
  HSV-2 is sexually transmitted.</p>
  
  <p>Until recently, scientists assumed that HSV-1 infections were not
  sexually transmitted. Now, scientists know that either type can be
  found in either the oral or genital area, as well as at other sites.
  In fact, researchers estimate that HSV-1 is responsible for up to half
  of all new cases of genital herpes.</p>
  
  <p>To infect people, HSV-1 and HSV-2 must get into the body through
  broken skin or a mucous membrane, such as inside the mouth or in the
  genital area. In addition to the fluid from fever blisters, each virus
  can be carried in bodily fluids like saliva, semen, and fluid in the
  female genital tract.</p>
  
  <p>Both herpes viruses may cause genital infections, and both can be
  contagious even if the infected person does not have active symptoms
  or visible blisters.
  [Ibid.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)</strong></p>

<p>HPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease.  Most Americans have had it and didn't know it.  It is transmitted through oral sex as well as vaginally and anally, and condoms provide only partial protection.</p>

<p>HPV can cause oral, anal, and genital cancers, warts, and a variety of other unpleasant problems.  These effects sometimes take years to show up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While there is no cure for HPV, the good news is the infection often
  clears on its own. If it does not, and treatment is needed, there are
  many HPV treatment options. Plus, as more people are vaccinated with
  the new HPV vaccines, the rates of infection may be greatly reduced.</p>
  
  <p>For now, HPV treatment focuses on the symptoms of the infection.
  Symptoms include genital warts associated with low-risk HPV types
  (which don't generally lead to cancers) and the precancerous changes
  sometimes associated with the high-risk types of HPV.

<p>There are around a hundred strains of HPV; the Gardasil vaccine protects against HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18, the most common and dangerous ones.</p>

<p>HPV is believed to be responsible for about 5% of all cancers worldwide.  If you are 25 or under and haven't received the Gardasil HPV vaccine, get it now! Make sure you get all three shots.</p>

<p>If you are a parent, be sure your daughters AND your sons get all three shots, preferably in 6th grade, or as soon as possible after that.</p>
