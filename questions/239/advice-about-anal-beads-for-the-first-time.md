I have recently come to learn about anal beads after seeing them used in a movie.

I got curious and read about them for a while, but I can't decide what kind to buy and frankly I am also not sure how to use it safely, even when I had chosen and gotten the product.

So my question is double:

1. What are recommended types/brands of anal beads for first time users?
2. How to safely use them?

I should also mention, that I do have experience with other sex toys like anal plugs, but the beads just look much more intimidating.

A good material for sex toys is medical-grade silicone. To sanitize these, boil them vigorously for 8-10 minutes. 

Use a high quality water based lubricant. Silicone lubricant can react with some formulations of silicone toys. Do not use numbing lube; you want to be able to feel discomfort (aka impending bodily harm) so you can adjust your usage. If you think you need more lube while using it, you need a lot more lube. Don't be stingy! 

Inspect the toy before usage. If anything is ripping or looks broken, discard the toy and start looking for a replacement. Things getting stuck up your butt means a very embarrassing ER trip! All anal toys should have a flared base that keeps it securly outside of you (in the case of anal beads, the largest bead should remain outside of you for maximum safety. the pull ring can get sucked inside of you by your anal muscles and then you will be sad).

Good brands for anal toys include: Tantus, Liberator, LELO, Tenga, and OhMyBod. Make sure all toys that you buy are made of medical grade silicone (not food grade, as it has a lower standard of manufacture and sanitization) and do not have sharp edges.  

Any toy you put in your butt is a butt toy forever. Do not put it in mouths or vaginas unless you autoclave/boil vigorously, and even then I would not recommend it. The bacteria in your gut needs to stay in your gut!

Remember to work slowly with the beads. You don't need to stuff them all in at once. They're meant to be taken in and out as you feel comfortable.

First of all, since all the bodies are different, I'd say that you'd have to choose something that you can get confortable with. You do mention other experiences with sex toys, so you know that you can't start with huge diameters and so on.  
Select a product that is hypoallergenic and cannot be broken. Remember that your health must come before everything else, so maybe spend a little more money to nullify the possibility of mild to severe incidents.  
About safety, if you exclude any "stupid" use of the toy (like trying to ingest it and so on...), I'd strongly recommend use with lubricant (commercial ones are to be found in supermarkets too) and to wash the toy before **and** after the use. Store it in a dry cool place, read the instructions and...  

...May seem stupid or cause embarassement, but a lot of clerk in shops have usually knowledge about what they sell, so if you don't know something, just ask.
