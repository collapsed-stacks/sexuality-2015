Can a person have an allergic reaction to a sex partner?  If so, is it something in the body fluids, or is it just a reaction to the other person's bath products, deodorant, cologne, hand lotion, etc?

In some people sexual arousal can cause the mucous membranes in the nostrils to swell, which causes sneezing in some people. Could potentially worsen allergy symptoms.
