What is the proper use of a female condom? Who can use it? Can all women use it, including women-who-have-never-been-penetrated-by-anything?

<p>People who have functional vaginas can use the female condom. Since you need to insert it, people who are not used to being penetrated may find it harder or more uncomfortable to place it correctly. However, this caveat extends to many foreign objects, such as fingers or penises. With practice, placing the female condom gets easier.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/female-condom" rel="nofollow">How to use a female condom:</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Put spermicide or lubricant on the outside of the closed end.</li>
  <li>Find a comfortable position. You can stand with one foot on a chair, sit on the edge of a chair, lie down, or squat.</li>
  <li>Squeeze together the sides of the inner ring at the closed end of the condom and insert it into the vagina like a tampon.</li>
  <li>Push the inner ring into the vagina as far as it can go â€” until it reaches the cervix.</li>
  <li>Pull out your finger and let the outer ring hang about an inch outside the vagina.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>If you want to use the female condom for anal intercourse, follow above instructions for inserting it into the anus.</p>
  
  <p>During vaginal intercourse, it is normal for the female condom to move side to side. Stop intercourse if the penis slips between the condom and the walls of the vagina or if the outer ring is pushed into the vagina. As long as your partner has not yet ejaculated, you can gently remove the condom from the vagina, add extra spermicide or lubricant, and insert it once again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To remove the condom safely, grasp the outer ring and twist the condom like you would a plastic bag. Pull it out gently, and throw it away.</p>
