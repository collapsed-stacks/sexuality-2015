It has already been covered why not [to reuse a condom][1] between multiple sexual encounters. Essentially, a condom wears out through use and it loses its effectiveness if a couple reuses it between bouts of intercourse. Specifically, in the context of this question, the risk of tearing a condom increases if a couple reuses it.

Is there a maximum amount of time a condom should be used during a _single_ sexual encounter, assuming no male orgasm with ejaculate?

For example: suppose a couple were engaging in vaginal intercourse for a whole hour. Would there be an elevated risk of condom malfunction due to the increased amount of time? Would the risk be significantly lowered by taking a short break halfway through to put a fresh condom on?

I know it would not be _detrimental_ to safety to put on a fresh condom. This question is specifically about the _risk_ of malfunction. Is using a fresh condom during a lengthy intercourse session a wise idea or is it simply a psychological exercise in feeling extra safe?

<p>Don't worry, there's no reason the condom would degrade time passing by while it's lubricated; until the expiration date, you are safe. However, it's far more common for the erection to be lost at some point during that long time-frame than for the penis to fit perfectly into the condom after an hour. Even with some loss of erection the condom may shift, resulting in possible tearing. </p>

<p>If your erection is not lost before the latex is worn out through the limited friction it encounters [after several years], then you will surely have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9lbuf/i_lost_my_penis_due_to_priapism_ama/" rel="nofollow">lost your penis from priapism</a>. The reasons condoms break include because of passing the expiration date, insufficient lubricant, improper storage, improper wear. As long as the condom did not shift, and the erection was not lost, there is no reason to replace it.</p>

<p>But <strong>definitely do get a fresh condom if any shifting occurred</strong>. Why would you not?</p>
