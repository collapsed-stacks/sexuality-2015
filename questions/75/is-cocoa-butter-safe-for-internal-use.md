Coconut oil is widely hailed as a natural, long-lasting, great-feeling personal lubricant.  It's good for the skin.  Importantly, it's safe for internal (anal or vaginal) use, and will not cause an infection.

Similarly to coconut oil, cocoa butter has a pleasant odor and is widely used as a skin moisturizer.  It melts easily from the body's natural warmth, and feels silky smooth - but is it safe for internal use?

I'd like to create my own homemade personal lubricant/cream.  It would be a blend of coconut oil, cocoa butter, and scented essential oils.  But I want to ensure that the ingredients are all safe for internal use.

**Important Note**: coconut oil - while safe and effective as a personal lubricant - is not safe to use with latex condoms.  It will degrade the condom, and you may wind up with a miniature version of you.

Cocoa butter is an effective and viable industrial lubricant.<sup>1</sup>

Cocoa butter is also an ingredient in commercial personal lubricants.<sup>2</sup> Hopefully, if it is used in commercial personal lubricants, it has to be a safe product to use!
