Can someone who has herpes on their lips while giving oral to their partner transmit the virus to the genitals?

If so, is it "genital herpes" then, or is it still herpes, but located on the genitals? Or is there no risk at all, other than transmission while kissing?

<p>There are a number of factors here.  First, know that there are two types of the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), associated with herpes.  HSV-1 infections tend to happen at the mouth, and HSV-2 infections tend to happen at the genitals.  That said, it is definitely possible for HSV-1 infections to happen at the genitals, and for HSV-2 infections to happen at the mouth.  So it's possible to have "genital herpes" that's HSV-1, or to have "oral herpes" that's HSV-2.  That said, genital HSV-1 is less common than genital HSV-2, and oral HSV-2 is comparatively rare, relative to oral HSV-1.</p>

<p>So, to say that it "does... result in transmission" would be putting it too strongly, as transmission of HSV-1 to the genitals is <em>relatively</em> unlikely.  However, to say that there's "no risk at all" would also be putting it much too strongly, in the other direction.  Such transmission can and does occur, and is not rare.</p>

<p>In the example you give, it would depend entirely on which virus they have on their lips.  In spite of the names, "oral herpes" (HSV-1) can cause genital infections and "genital herpes" (HSV-2) can cause oral infections.  They are also extremely common, especially HSV-1.</p>

<p>From <em>Human Herpesviruses: Biology, Therapy, and Immunoprophylaxis</em>, Arvin A, Campadelli-Fiume G, Mocarski E, et al., editors. Cambridge University Press; 2007:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Herpes simplex viruses are among the most ubiquitous of human
  infections. The frequency of HSV infection has been measured by
  testing various populations for the presence of antibody, as both
  virus and the immune response are thought to persist after infection
  for the life of the host. Worldwide, âˆ¼90% of people have one or both
  viruses. </p>
  
  <p>HSV-1 is the more prevalent virus, with 65% of persons in the United
  States having antibodies to HSV-1 (Xu et al., 2002). The epidemiology
  in Europe is similar, with at least half of the population
  seropositive for HSV-1. In the developing world, HSV-1 is almost
  universal, and usually acquired from intimate contact with family in
  early childhood (Whitley et al., 1998).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Epidemiologists think HSV-1 may now be the cause of half or almost half of all genital herpes infections in the U.S.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Until recently, scientists assumed that HSV-1 infections were not
  sexually transmitted. Now, scientists know that either type can be
  found in either the oral or genital area, as well as at other sites.
  In fact, <strong>researchers estimate that HSV-1 is responsible for up to half
  of all new cases of genital herpes.</strong></p>
  
  <p>To infect people, HSV-1 and HSV-2 must get into the body through
  broken skin or a mucous membrane, such as inside the mouth or in the
  genital area. In addition to the fluid from fever blisters, each virus
  can be carried in bodily fluids like saliva, semen, and fluid in the
  female genital tract.</p>
  
  <p>Both herpes viruses may cause genital infections, and both can be
  contagious even if the infected person does not have active symptoms
  or visible blisters. [Source: <a href="http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/herpes-simplex-virus#ixzz3hg4fgkkQ" rel="nofollow">Herpes simplex virus</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>HSV-1 and HSV-2 produce "clinically indistinguishable facial and genital lesions."  The main reason HSV-1 is less noticeable as a genital infection is that "HSV-2 causes symptomatic genital recurrences at a much higher frequency than HSV-1." [Source: <a href="http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/1/150.full" rel="nofollow">Genital Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 in Women</a>]</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: </p>

<p>Both viruses infect the mouth, throat, genitals and anus and can be transmitted by surface contact as well as exchange of fluids.  Given a choice, HSV-1 is less bad because it remains dormant longer and creates fewer outbreaks.  Otherwise, there's no difference in terms of pain, lesions, etc.</p>
