While coming to these 'naughty sites', I always see ads about increasing the size of the male genital organ. I assume these are all just fake, but is there a way to actually increase the size of your penis?

This was considered in a study published in 2011 in the British Journal of Urologists

<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2010.09647.x/epdf">Link here</a>

The main conclusion of the study was that, among non-surgical methods, penis extenders (small devices attached to the penis that stretch it) gave the best length gains.  A study from 2002 cited in that paper found that men reported an average increase of 1.8cm after wearing their extender for 6 hours a day over four months.  

The report is less positive about other forms of penile enhancement, such as vacuum pumps, which appear to be ineffective and dangerous.  

Given the limited research into the efficacy of these devices, and into their potential harm, I would approach any method of penis enlargement with caution, but I would hazard a guess that manual stretching of the penis is the best non-surgical method not involving specialized equipment.  

**WARNING:** Do not take the dangers of any form of penis enlargement lightly.  Putting too much stress on the penis for too long can lead to bruising, severe pain and the permanent inability to have an erection, among other things.

<p>Among sex researchers, it's well known that women are notoriously unreliable in estimating male penis size, tending to add one to three inches to a current lover's dimensions and to subtract similar amounts from their recollections of their exes, particularly after angry breakups.  This has led to some standing jokes in the field, like this chart:</p>

<p>... And this common answer by sex educators to the OP's question: </p>

<p><strong><em>The only reliable form of penis enhancement is true love.</em></strong></p>

<p>It may be a joke, but the implicit point is quite true: nothing else has been shown to be safe, effective, and reliable.</p>

There are a number of surgical procedures (all with significant risks and downsides) that can increase the length or girth of a penis. Common procedures include:

* Transplanting tissue (fat, skin or even blood vessels) from other areas of the body. While increasing girth, this can adversely affect sensitivity and even lead to the inability to have an orgasm.
* By cutting some of the tissue above base of the penis, usually severing the suspensory ligament, and then pulling the penis out, it is possible to "externalize" a slightly bigger part of it. The effect is, however, limited.

[This source](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/502344) provides more detailed information on Penile Enlargement Surgery.

While moderate length gains have been reported as a result of stretching the penis without surgery, it is unclear whether these effects are permanent.
