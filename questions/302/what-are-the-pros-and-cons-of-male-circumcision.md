Medical reasons for circumcision
--------------------------------

**Pro:** Circumcision prevents phimosis (the inability to retract the foreskin at an age when it should normally be retractable), paraphimosis (the painful inability to return the foreskin to its original location), and balanoposthitis (inflammation of the glans and foreskin).<sup>1</sup>

**Pro:** Circumcision may result in a decreased incidence of urinary tract infections.<sup>1</sup>

**Pro:** Circumcision may result in a lower incidence of sexually transmitted diseases and may reduce HIV transmission.<sup>1</sup>

**Pro:** Circumcision may lower the risk for cancer of the cervix in sexual partners.<sup>2</sup>

**Pro:** Circumcision may decrease the risk for cancer of the penis.<sup>1</sup>

**Con:** Circumcision increases the chance of meatitis (inflammation of the opening of the penis). It also gives rise to other minor but manageable problems. <sup>3</sup>

**Victorian era:** 

During the Victorian era, male circumcision was prescribed as a treatment for masturbation, which may be the reason for the widespread cultural, non-religious circumcision of American baby boys.
