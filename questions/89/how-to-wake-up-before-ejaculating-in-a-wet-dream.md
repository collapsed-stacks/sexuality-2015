I'm a male 23. Is there any technique that helps you wake up before ejaculating in a wet dream? I just hate that if I can wake on time, I can enjoy the ejaculation and need not to clean the mess.

I don't believe there exists one.

But, to add, if you want to stop that, I'd suggest that whenever you're in your wet dream and you feel that you are indulged in those erotic acts, you should wake up to enjoy the facets of dream and then you can masturbate by visualising those scenes.

That said, I believe from regular such practice you can master not to have ejaculation in the dreams.
