For a while now I'm having unprotected intercourse with my partner in hopes of pregnancy, but nothing yet happened.

I would like to know, how long can this take **normally** for most couples to get pregnant before seeking medical advice?

There might be probably a lot of factors playing a role but there should be a normal range for normal couples, so you know it's time to go to a doctor and see what's wrong.

Personally, I would do that after a year or so, maybe even bit less.

After some research I found [this article](http://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1813/how-long-will-it-take-to-get-pregnant) which appears legit enough, and says:

> ###How long does it usually take to get pregnant?

>In general, a fertile couple has a good chance of getting pregnant within a year, as out of 100 couples trying to conceive naturally: 

> - 20 will conceive within one month
- 70 will conceive within six months
- 85 will conceive within one year
- 90 will conceive within 18 months
- 95 will conceive within two years

So based on this, if after two years of trying you still has no success, there is a high chance it's due to medical problem, and not just out of luck.
