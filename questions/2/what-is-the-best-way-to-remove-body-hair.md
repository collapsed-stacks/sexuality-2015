I want to know the best way (in which the growth rate is the least) to remove male body hair (particularly pubic hair and the hair in the armpits).

What is the best (natural) way to remove hair that results in the slowest regrowth? 

> BEST here means that the hair grow with least growth rate taking more
> time than usual other ways like shaving,etc? Also, if softer hairs are
> possible, then please consider that too.

I am aware of hair removal creams and shaving. Are there any other means by which people achieve this?

Any method that pulls hair out by its roots will have the longest impact with the best regrowth. That's one of the reasons waxing is popular. 

By removing the hair at the roots, waxing accomplishes a few things:

 - First, it creates an actually-smooth surface. Shaving, much the same way your face works, can leave subble and a rough/coarse texture.
 - Hair regrows with its nominal texture. Remember that what you're doing when you shave anywhere is actually shearing the ends of the hair; that causes them to splinter and feel rough/coarse. Naturally-grown beards can be quite soft; it's usually only after shaving that they begin to feel course.

    Waxing solves this problem, simply by pulling hair out by its roots. When the entire hair regrows, it has its initial texture. 
 - It also fulfills your 'slowest regrowth' requirement. By pulling the hair out at its roots, the entire hair needs to regrow, which is a much longer process than simply growing out from the surface of your skin. 

There are other, more permanent methods of hair removal such as [laser hair removal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_hair_removal). These methods revolve around killing the hair follicles themselves, which is an operation that cannot be undone. However, if that's a decision you want to make, it will permanently solve the problem.

As far as the pubic hair are concerned I suggest one should refrain from using any type of razors/blades mainly because of two reasons.

 1. There are no studies I know of that support the fact that hair regrowth is affected after shaving. i.e. shaving resulting in thicker and harder hair. However, I can definitely say that if you shave your pubes, you will have to make it a habit to shave them quite regularly as even after minor growth, the hair would start pinching you in all the wrong places (Do not even think of shaving the hair around your anus for this very reason). I would like to add that this is particularly true for men from the Indian subcontinent. Men from other parts of the world might have different views/experiences.
 2. Genitals are not a smooth terrain and sometimes it gets tricky to cover all the areas which you want to cover. I do not recommend using any types of razors on or around genitals just because of the possibility of a cut.

In my opinion using a good quality trimmer (with a guard) to trim the pubes and then using a hair remover for the final touch lasts a good time. Do use a moisturizer regularly to keep them soft and avoid any chances of itchiness. As far as underarms are concerned, reaching them with a trimmer and applying hair remover can be tricky and hence shaving is the most suitable option. It will just add 4 5 extra minutes to your bath time during the weekends. 

Laser hair removal is something that I have never tried and thinking of pulling the hair from their roots sends shivers through my spines.

Hair on each part of your body grows at its own rate.  Unless you kill the hair follicles, the method of removal won't affect the growth rate at all, in spite of many myths to the contrary.  So the time for hair to regrow to a certain length depends entirely on how much of each hair you remove.  Razors lop it off at skin level.  Tweezers, waxing, sugaring, etc. pull it out by the roots so it takes longer to grow back above the surface.

Any razor you can use on your face should work for everything else except your penis and scrotum.  For those two areas, I recommend a multi-bladed manual razor.
My partner uses one that has five blades in each replaceable cartridge and it takes him only a minute or two per week to swipe the hairs from the shaft and around the base of the penis.

I also recommend using scissors every week or two to trim the pubic hair above the penis to an inch or so if yours grows much longer than that.  Some men prefer to shave it completely, and some women prefer it that way.  (If in doubt, ask!) 

One interesting tidbit:  trimming or shaving the long pubes down there can make a man's penis appear larger from his own perspective, contributing to a subtle confidence boost!

But what about the balls?  Most men have a lot of long hairs growing from the scrotum.  If you don't care about getting oral in that area, that's fine.  But if you do, you need to learn how to shave your scrotum and then keep it hair-free.  This takes longer, perhaps 10 minutes a week.

A lot of men are scared to take a razor down there.  Don't be.  Modern multi-bladed razors work fine as long as you stretch the skin smooth and use a light touch. Don't scrape hard the way you shave your face!  The skin on the scrotum is much thinner and more delicate, and you don't want to shave the tops off the little sebum glands the hairs grow out of.

When my SO shaves his shaft and scrotum, he does it dry with a very light touch.  He prefers shaving dry in that area because wet skin is softer and easier to cut and shaving cream just interferes with his vision.

Whatever you do, do NOT try using an electric razor on your penis or scrotum. Some electrics do work down there, but most don't, and figuring out which is which can be a bloody and painful process!

Tweezing, waxing, and "sugaring" pull your hair out by its roots.  This hurts and leaves the area red and angry for a while, but it lasts longer before you can feel a stubble.  

Electrolysis or laser treatment can remove hair permanently, but both are expensive and it takes multiple sessions over ~6 months to get almost all of the hair.  Lasers work best with darker hair and fair skin, so that option may not work for you if you have dark skin or very light hair.
