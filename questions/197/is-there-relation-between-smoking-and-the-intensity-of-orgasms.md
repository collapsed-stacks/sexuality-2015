## Is there relation between smoking and the intensity of orgasms?

I am a male, and during my life I have at some points smoked and and some periods I quit for up to two years. 

One downside of quitting smoking is that I seem to notice my orgasms are more intense (more of a satisfying drug-like effect) in periods when I smoke.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Is there any research about this?

It wouldn't seem surprising that there is a link, since both orgasm and smoking influence neuro transmitters like dopamine.

<p>In the short run, nicotine is a potent stimulant that increases your pulse rate and your blood pressure and makes you more alert, so it would not be at all unusual for it to increase the intensity of your orgasm.</p>

<p>In the long run, smoking tobacco damages your circulation and ages your skin, both of which will make it harder to feel sensations and to become aroused.  Smoking is well known to contribute to impotence, so it is safe to say that it reduces the intensity of orgasms.</p>

I've experienced nothing of the sort. And the evidence seems to show that smoking can reduce, at the very least, your ability to maintain an erection. Also, there's a huge body of evidence that shows that smoking kills the tiny cappilaries close to the skin all over the body  (including the penis), thereby causing reduced sensitivity over time and reduced bloodflow, as I mentioned earlier. 

My suggestion is to quit smoking and enjoy a better sex life. Now, you personally, may experience some kind of high from smoking, and an additional high from sex -- the two may be working together in some way. There's no good reason I can think of however, that smoking would increase the intensity of one's orgasm... Unless the lack of oxygen to the brain is partly to blame. Good luck and have fun.
