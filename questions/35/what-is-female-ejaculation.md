Among the many things that seem to happen in pornography more than in actuality is female ejaculation, or squirting, which seems to be an intense form of orgasm. Is it like a strong orgasm? And... what is it? The fluid... I mean.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_ejaculation" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia on Female ejaculation</a> says the following :-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Female ejaculation is the expulsion of fluid by the paraurethral ducts
  through and around the human female urethra during or before an
  orgasm. It is also known colloquially as squirting or gushing,
  although these are considered to be different phenomena in some
  research publications.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The exact source and nature of the fluid continue to be a topic of debate among medical professionals, which is also related to doubts over the existence of the G-spot.</strong></p>

<p>It's a controversial subject, not least because pornography writers (most of whom are male) have repeatedly suggested that all women ejaculate at orgasm. This is completely untrue!</p>

<p>The reality is that regular ejaculation isn't all that common. Some women do it once in a lifetime, but never again.</p>

<p>The actual percentage of females who ejaculate is uncertain. However, in Masters and Johnson's famous lab experiments with over 400 women, they did not record anyone who ejaculated at climax.</p>

<p><strong>What research has been done on the fluid?</strong></p>

<p>There hasn't been enough research on the fluid (ejaculate) – partly because it's difficult to obtain adequate supplies of it for investigation. Also, large scientific funds tend to be available for life-threatening diseases rather than for sexual problems.</p>

<p>However, recent research suggests the ejaculate is an alkaline liquid that isn't like urine, because it doesn't contain urea or creatinine, which are normal urinary constituents. The fluid tends to be clear coloured and doesn't stain bedclothes yellow – again, unlike urine.</p>

<p>Researchers have claimed that it contains some chemical ingredients similar to those produced by the male prostate – notably PSA (prostate-specific antigen). It is also said to contain two sugars: glucose and fructose.
Since 2000, an increasing number of researchers have suggested the liquid may be the secretion of Skene's glands (the paraurethral glands). These are tiny structures which lie around the female urethra (the urinary pipe).</p>

<p>In 2007, Viennese researcher Dr Florian Wimpissinger published an important study on two women who habitually ejaculated. (Incidentally, this surname is not some sort of joke! Dr Wimpissinger genuinely is a well-known urologist in Vienna.) He and his colleagues found that the ejaculate from these two females was chemically very different from that of their urine.
In particular, it contained more prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), more prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and also some glucose.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/seriouslyscience/2015/01/12/proof-female-ejaculation-just-pee/" rel="nofollow">Some other resources' views :-</a> </p>

<p>Previous experiments ignored the physical source of the copious fluid. But,lately, in 2015, the researchers took it one step further by performing ultrasounds before and after ejaculation, as well as testing the biochemical properties of the liquid. It turned out that not only is it chemically identical to urine, but the bladder emptied during the period of ejaculation coinciding with orgasm. It’s probably just pee after all!</p>

<p><strong>THEIR CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The present data based on ultrasonographic bladder monitoring and biochemical analyses indicate that squirting is essentially the involuntary emission of urine during sexual activity, although a marginal contribution of prostatic secretions to the emitted fluid often exists.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How much fluid is produced?</strong></p>

<p>I(not me, the previous source's author) have heard claims that highly-sexed women can produce litres of fluid in a single orgasm. This seems very unlikely – after all, where could such an amount be stored in the female body?</p>
