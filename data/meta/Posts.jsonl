It explains how psychologists and psychiatrists identify a problem, what separates normal fetishes from disorders, and the criteria used to diagnose these disorders.</p></li>\n<li><p>The first answer has 9 upvotes.  My answer has two downvotes (actually, it has 3 downvotes and one upvote).  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This isn't about my feelings being hurt, or my pride being wounded.  I've been around long enough to know that you shouldn't take upvotes and downvotes personally.  Frankly, I don't have a problem with a better answer beating my own answer - in fact, I see it as a chance to learn how to write better answers, and to learn from someone who is apparently better informed than I am.  </p>\n\n<p>But the flip side of being around long enough to take votes with a grain of salt is that I've also been around long enough to recognize the superior answer, whether it is mine or someone else's.  In this case, my answer is clearly the better one, not because I wrote it, but because it is better referenced, more comprehensive, and strictly limited to hard facts rather than opinions.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm a bit concerned that despite our good intentions, some topics which are bound to come up on this site are so personal and intimate, and therefore are associated with such strong emotional feelings, that it is difficult to abide by the SE maxim that opinion-based answers are generally undesirable.  </p>\n\n<p>In other words, people have such strong feelings about their sexual lives that an objective answer which contradicts their preexisting beliefs is likely to come across as a personal insult.  We don't like to hear our sexual activities called into question.  It is extremely difficult to remain objective and avoid taking new information that goes against what we already believe as a personal attack.  </p>\n\n<p>This isn't a problem that will affect every question here:  questions about sexual health, STDs, impotence, and medical issues are easily and objectively answerable.  But when the question is something like \"Is a fetish a sign of dysfunction?\", and the answer is \"Sometimes, yes, a fetish is a sign of dysfunction\", it becomes very likely that people who have fetishes won't want to hear the correct answer.  Why?  Because it creates the unpleasant possibility that something you enjoy might not be healthy.  </p>\n\n<p>I might be wrong, but I think there is some truth to my line of reasoning.  I don't know how we should handle this problem, or if it can even <em>be</em> handled.  I didn't want to make a stink over nothing, so I brought the issue to the attention of some people on the SF&amp;F SE.  Every one of them, including at least one moderator, agreed with my assessment.  I didn't solicit an evaluation of my answer versus the other answer, but I got such an evaluation anyway.  Again, everyone agreed that mine was the better answer. I then mentioned my interpretation of the issue I described above, and yet again, everyone agreed that this was probably the problem. </p>\n\n<p>On my primary SE site (Science Fiction and Fantasy), I am somewhat competitive, although I still prefer for the best answer to win, even if it isn't my own.  I feel no such competitive urges here, because the subject matter is so much more important than <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.  People's health and emotional wellbeing are involved.  </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, on this site, I don't care about getting rep or badges.  All that matters is providing people with the information they need to make informed decisions.  The more comprehensive answer with the best sources should be the one that gets the most attention, because that answer is the one that is most likely to help the OP. If this situation is an indicator of what the future holds in store for the site, I think we should be a bit worried.  </p>\n\n<p>How do we deal with this?  And is this site different from all the other SE sites?  When the question is about personal sexual preferences, activities, and turn ons, do we value the most comforting answer, or the best referenced, most comprehensive answer?

No teacher tells his students what \u00bbeating out\u00ab or \u00bbgiving head\u00ab means. When ever words in the field of sexuality are taught in school or in a course for adults, they are clinical and scientific terms. It's even hard to find words like \u00bbboner\u00ab or \u00bbto wank\u00ab in a english-to-foreign-language-dictionary.

Many sex educators and therapists wrestle with tone issues all the time, and most of them have a distinctive vocabulary that I would call \"popular\" - informal, not too scientific, but definitely not crude, and often accompanied by definitions or equivalent terms to encourage more accurate usage. For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Don't use \"pussy\". Use \"vagina\".</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would say:  </p>\n\n<p><em>Don't use \"pussy\". Use \"vulva\" or \"vagina\", depending on whether you are talking about the external or internal female genitals.</em></p>\n\n<p>The problem with asking people to use clinical terms is that many of them will MISuse them.  E.g., <strong>far too many people say \"vagina\" when they mean \"vulva.\"</strong>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don't use \"cock\". Use \"penis\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would say:  <em>Don't use \"dick\". Use \"cock\" or \"penis\".</em>  </p>\n\n<p>\"Dick\" is pejorative, \"cock\" is merely informal. The goal should be clarity, not formality for its own sake.</p>\n\n<p>Just because a word has a Latin origin doesn't mean it's automatically a good choice.  For example, to my ear, \"coitus, ... copulation, ... [and] fornication\" all sound stilted and are inferior to \"sex\" or \"intercourse.\"  (Plus, \"fornication\" is an overtly biased, religious, and hostile term.)</p>\n\n<p>And just because a word is slang, or a recent coinage, doesn't mean that it's the wrong choice either.  For example, a recent question dealt with \"vaginal farting,\" a term that a lot of people would object to.  I supplied the correct term (\"queefing\") in my answer.  It is certainly slang, but it is also the primary term used for the subject, and people need to know what it is called if they are going to search for further information.</p>\n\n<p>The goal should be to communicate clearly without offending a normal person.  We should certainly avoid terms with negative or pejorative meanings - cunt, faggot, asshole, dick, and any other term commonly used as an insult - but we also need to avoid being <strong>overly</strong> formal and using obscure words without defining them, because that creates a stilted sex-negative feeling and drives away many readers.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 228, "LastEditorUserId": 228, "LastEditDate": "2015-08-09T04:58:46.310", "LastActivityDate": "2015-08-09T04:58:46.310", "CommentCount": 0}
