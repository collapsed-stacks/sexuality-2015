No teacher tells his students what »eating out« or »giving head« means. When ever words in the field of sexuality are taught in school or in a course for adults, they are clinical and scientific terms. It's even hard to find words like »boner« or »to wank« in a english-to-foreign-language-dictionary. So when arguing with non-native-speakers, you end up with »use clinical terms«, not with »use slang«.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**BUT:**  &#xD;&#xA;When ever you english is good enough to be able to read and understand Questions and Answers on StackExchange, then you already have found a way to learn slang words and know most of them.

In particular, the &quot;challenged or likely to be challenged&quot; standard for when to cite sources might be a good one.  Which would make it OK to not bother finding sources for many things, yet if they're challenged, it's up to the original author (or any subsequent editor) to find such sources and present them to back up claims.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, I think for questions that are fairly basic in nature, citing wikipedia itself is likely sufficient for an also-basic-in-nature answer, which may be all that is needed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And if a statement is unlikely to be challenged (&quot;HSV is very common&quot;, say), then in the absence of a challenge, it seems fair game to me to just state it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Generally, though, I'm of the opinion that it's worth holding ourselves to a high standard for verifiability and accuracy.

I think it's good that we think about what sorts of answers we should most favor on the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think a few things from [the sex educator training I took][1] may be useful here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

As someone prone to giving long-winded answers myself, I've come to realize that sometimes, that's not effective, even if everything you're saying is accurate, correct, and potentially useful to someone.  They need a take-away.  They need something they can digest.  Take-away here: Your answer was too long, and not limited enough in its information.  Even your TL;DR section was longer than the question by a factor of 4&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;2. &quot;Positive-Neutral Tone&quot; (also fitting in with the P in PLISSIT, which stands for Permission) - combined, these ideas basically say that you want to make it OK for someone to have asked their question (including, on this site, later people who stumble across it from their google searches), while generally giving neutral information. Taking an example from your answer, &quot;It depends on what the fetish is, whether it causes problems in your life outside of your sexual relations, and a number of other factors.&quot;  This perhaps takes the neutral too far; a suggested re-phrase, with a bit of positivity might be: &quot;As long as fetishes aren't causing problems in one's life, they're probably healthy.  When they start interfering with day-to-day life, that's when it might be classified as dysfunction.&quot;  That's probably not perfect, especially for that question as-asked.  The point I'm trying to make, though, is to give someone something that's just on the positive side of neutral, so they can feel OK about going forward from wherever they are now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I could perhaps go on and on about this, but... To do so would counteract the point of my answer.  I've probably already said to much. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Footnote (cited multiple times for the same note on purpose):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; - not that's _necessarily_ a bad thing, but it's probably a sign that there's a mismatch.  If a question is specifically asking (even in a few words) for a detailed analysis of something, then this sort of discrepancy would make sense. But this question asked two essentially yes/no questions, prefaced with &quot;Generally speaking&quot;.  So in this case, it wasn't a fit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://sfsi.org/training/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLISSIT_model" />

If one is talking about biological sex, male and female may be more appropriate.  Also, the latter words would be more appropriate when used as adjectives, e.g. if referring to testes as &quot;male gonads&quot; or ovaries as &quot;female gonads&quot; (for whatever reason, I'm aiming for a simple example).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, *all* of this still resides within a binary construction of sex and gender, and for at least some questions, it would probably be good to be trans*-inclusive as well, by saying things like &quot;many people with ovaries ...&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're speaking of an (adult) individual, whose gender is known (or has reason to be presumed in a hypothetical), I'd go with &quot;man&quot; or &quot;woman&quot;, over &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;.

How come sites like Christianity or Skeptics (or... any other .SE site) don't come under that scrutiny which clearly are not work related, and could be an issue for SO career recruiters? If I were a recruiter, alarm bells would definitely ring *more* loudly for [this question on Hermeneutics][1], than for [this one on Sexuality][2]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For me keeping up with questions on Skeptics is *way* more emotionally draining than it was for this site - and [don't even get me started][3] on the questions I run into from some other sub-sites. I honestly don't get that part - why is it somehow more draining to think of sexuality?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Volume was disappointing, but there were definitely good questions and well sourced answers in there. I would not cite the lack of Sex Educators as a concern, but more the lack of questions that would need the expertise of one.

I think many more of these would surface with a broader user base that explicitly does not require more educators, merely informed practitioners. Teaching children about sex is different from discussing issues with practitioners of it, and treating psychiatric issues is definitely not involved in the questions that were posed here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With the reasons given here it seems like it was a project that was expected to fail - since the problem of separating professional from private was surely already seen in earlier iterations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/686/were-the-nephilim-in-genesis-6-aliens&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/questions/2/what-is-the-best-way-to-remove-body-hair&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/238936/remove-religion-se-sites-from-hot-network-questions&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/questions/25/what-does-percent-effective-mean-on-birth-control" />

Honestly, though, I got a bit disheartened early on by some of the content that was getting created, that seemed to lack the kind of quality I would want from a stack exchange site.  And while I did continue on and put some effort in after that, it was a lot less than it might have been.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And somehow, when I was trying to rally folks to come participate, during the commitment phase, I got much less traction than I'd been hoping for.  Maybe people just didn't get the vision of what this could have been.  Or maybe they imagined the problematic parts that I ended up seeing.  I don't know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I do know is that I could imagine it being tried again, and that if the right crowd of folks were lined up for the initial private beta, I could imagine it really working.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's hoping we'll see that day, some day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the mean time, I'd like to express thanks to those who did put a bunch of time and energy into this - including into correcting or improving the content that I added.
