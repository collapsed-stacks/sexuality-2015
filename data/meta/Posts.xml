Animal sexual behavior is often used as a baseline when studying normative human sexual behavior.  Studies on animal masturbation, homosexuality, sexual dominance, engaging in sexual activity for pleasure (as opposed to strictly for procreation), non-monogamy, etc, are easy to find, and are frequently used as a baseline to better understand human sexual behavior and urges.  It seems to me that this type of question ought to be on-topic here, as meaningful, interesting, and relevant to those who study human sexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is in contrast to other issues of animal sexual behavior which have no relevance to human sexual behavior, such as how rabbits respond to different pheromones in a potential partner, or how long collies are typically in heat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="64" LastEditorUserId="64" LastEditDate="2015-07-28T23:18:21.680" LastActivityDate="2015-07-31T21:38:09.447" Title="Is &quot;Animal voyeurism&quot; question on-topic?"

There are now two answers to the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both answers say more or less the same thing:  &quot;Sometimes a fetish is indicative of dysfunction, but in the vast majority of cases, it isn't.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first answer refers to two Wikipedia pages.  It contains one quote, a sentence long.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My answer refers to the DSM, which is the best source for information about psychological disorders,  and explains  how the DSM works, what it says about sexual fetishes, and what that means in common parlance. It includes a large number of quotations and references, and describes every fetish-related disorder recognized by the American Psychological Association.  It explains how psychologists and psychiatrists identify a problem, what separates normal fetishes from disorders, and the criteria used to diagnose these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first answer has 9 upvotes.  My answer has two downvotes (actually, it has 3 downvotes and one upvote).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This isn't about my feelings being hurt, or my pride being wounded.  I've been around long enough to know that you shouldn't take upvotes and downvotes personally.  Frankly, I don't have a problem with a better answer beating my own answer - in fact, I see it as a chance to learn how to write better answers, and to learn from someone who is apparently better informed than I am.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the flip side of being around long enough to take votes with a grain of salt is that I've also been around long enough to recognize the superior answer, whether it is mine or someone else's.  In this case, my answer is clearly the better one, not because I wrote it, but because it is better referenced, more comprehensive, and strictly limited to hard facts rather than opinions.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm a bit concerned that despite our good intentions, some topics which are bound to come up on this site are so personal and intimate, and therefore are associated with such strong emotional feelings, that it is difficult to abide by the SE maxim that opinion-based answers are generally undesirable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, people have such strong feelings about their sexual lives that an objective answer which contradicts their preexisting beliefs is likely to come across as a personal insult.  We don't like to hear our sexual activities called into question.  It is extremely difficult to remain objective and avoid taking new information that goes against what we already believe as a personal attack.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This isn't a problem that will affect every question here:  questions about sexual health, STDs, impotence, and medical issues are easily and objectively answerable.  But when the question is something like &quot;Is a fetish a sign of dysfunction?&quot;, and the answer is &quot;Sometimes, yes, a fetish is a sign of dysfunction&quot;, it becomes very likely that people who have fetishes won't want to hear the correct answer.  Why?  Because it creates the unpleasant possibility that something you enjoy might not be healthy.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I might be wrong, but I think there is some truth to my line of reasoning.  I don't know how we should handle this problem, or if it can even &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; handled.  I didn't want to make a stink over nothing, so I brought the issue to the attention of some people on the SF&amp;amp;F SE.  Every one of them, including at least one moderator, agreed with my assessment.  I didn't solicit an evaluation of my answer versus the other answer, but I got such an evaluation anyway.  Again, everyone agreed that mine was the better answer. I then mentioned my interpretation of the issue I described above, and yet again, everyone agreed that this was probably the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On my primary SE site (Science Fiction and Fantasy), I am somewhat competitive, although I still prefer for the best answer to win, even if it isn't my own.  I feel no such competitive urges here, because the subject matter is so much more important than &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;.  People's health and emotional wellbeing are involved.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, on this site, I don't care about getting rep or badges.  All that matters is providing people with the information they need to make informed decisions.  The more comprehensive answer with the best sources should be the one that gets the most attention, because that answer is the one that is most likely to help the OP. If this situation is an indicator of what the future holds in store for the site, I think we should be a bit worried.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do we deal with this?  And is this site different from all the other SE sites?

No teacher tells his students what »eating out« or »giving head« means. When ever words in the field of sexuality are taught in school or in a course for adults, they are clinical and scientific terms. It's even hard to find words like »boner« or »to wank« in a english-to-foreign-language-dictionary. So when arguing with non-native-speakers, you end up with »use clinical terms«, not with »use slang«.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;When ever you english is good enough to be able to read and understand Questions and Answers on StackExchange, then you already have found a way to learn slang words and know most of them.

As someone prone to giving long-winded answers myself, I've come to realize that sometimes, that's not effective, even if everything you're saying is accurate, correct, and potentially useful to someone.  They need a take-away.  They need something they can digest.  Take-away here: Your answer was too long, and not limited enough in its information.  Even your TL;DR section was longer than the question by a factor of 4&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Positive-Neutral Tone&quot; (also fitting in with the P in PLISSIT, which stands for Permission) - combined, these ideas basically say that you want to make it OK for someone to have asked their question (including, on this site, later people who stumble across it from their google searches), while generally giving neutral information. Taking an example from your answer, &quot;It depends on what the fetish is, whether it causes problems in your life outside of your sexual relations, and a number of other factors.&quot;  This perhaps takes the neutral too far; a suggested re-phrase, with a bit of positivity might be: &quot;As long as fetishes aren't causing problems in one's life, they're probably healthy.  When they start interfering with day-to-day life, that's when it might be classified as dysfunction.&quot;  That's probably not perfect, especially for that question as-asked.  The point I'm trying to make, though, is to give someone something that's just on the positive side of neutral, so they can feel OK about going forward from wherever they are now.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could perhaps go on and on about this, but...

I was trying to describe some of the background of this debate and to explain why you aren't ever going to be able to get a simple, objective answer to your question.

It's not enough to Google something and just paste the results into an answer.
