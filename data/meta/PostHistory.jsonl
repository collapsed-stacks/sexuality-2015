I don't know how we should handle this problem, or if it can even *be* handled.  I didn't want to make a stink over nothing, so I brought the issue to the attention of some people on the SF&F SE.  Every one of them, including at least one moderator, agreed with my assessment.  I didn't solicit an evaluation of my answer versus the other answer, but I got such an evaluation anyway.  Again, everyone agreed that mine was the better answer. I then mentioned my interpretation of the issue I described above, and yet again, everyone agreed that this was probably the problem. \r\n\r\nOn my primary SE site (Science Fiction and Fantasy), I am somewhat competitive, although I still prefer for the best answer to win, even if it isn't my own.  I feel no such competitive urges here, because the subject matter is so much more important than *Star Wars* and *The Lord of the Rings*.  People's health and emotional wellbeing are involved.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, on this site, I don't care about getting rep or badges.  All that matters is providing people with the information they need to make informed decisions.  The more comprehensive answer with the best sources should be the one that gets the most attention, because that answer is the one that is most likely to help the OP. If this situation is an indicator of what the future holds in store for the site, I think we should be a bit worried.  \r\n\r\nHow do we deal with this?  And is this site different from all the other SE sites?  When the question is about personal sexual preferences, activities, and turn ons, do we value the most comforting answer, or the best referenced, most comprehensive answer?  Is it possible to avoid bringing personal feelings into our voting in such cases?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/q/45/98"}

My reasons are several:\r\n\r\n* Lots of speculation/opinion (in the assumptions of the question itself, as well as the one answer written thus far);\r\n* It's talking about, if not promoting, a sexist misogyny sort of situation.\r\n* as far ad I can tell, there's either not really anything in a possible answer that would help someone with their contemporary sex life, or it could be asked in a way that leaves emperors entirely out of it.\r\n\r\nSo, on that third point especially:\r\n\r\nShould we allow questions that are about historical figures? Or even about contemporary figures? Like, would a question about a modern celebrity scandal be on topic?\r\n\r\nI'm kind of thinking this site should be about sexuality in relatively general ways. There could certainly be questions about specific things, but I think having it be about specific *people* is probably not deairable. Maybe that's even a better way to put this... I'd originally written the question as:\r\n\r\nAre questions about historical figures' sex lives on topic?\r\n\r\nChanged it. Another possible variation:\r\n\r\nShould questions about particular people (contemporary or historical) be on topic?"}

I think that all words should be allowed, that are usual when friends at an after-work-beer in a bar are talking about those topics.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't see a need to behave like nerdy headteachers.\r\n\r\nI think it's ok to use clinical and scientific terms when talking about topics like anatomy of sexual organs or the \u00bbtechnical\u00ab functioning of those organs. But sexuality is much more then this. If sex was a matter of the functioning of the organs of reproduction, mankind would have become extinct millions of years ago, because sex is very exhausting and tiring, and nobody would have done it if it wasn't that fun that it is.\r\n\r\nSexuality is fun, it is lustfulness, yearning and desire, and this is what is in the words *pussy*, *cock* and *fucking*. Words like *genitalia* or *intercourse* are missing the urge and lechery, that is the most important part of Sex. Without the horniness and randiness that we all feel when we do it, we wouldn't do it.\r\n\r\nSo when we are talking about the feelings, the stimulation and the excitation that is what makes sexuality to what it is, then it should be allowed to use the words that everybody uses to describe this topics.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSome words about non-native-speakers  \r\n--\r\nI'm a non-english-native-speaker (I speak German and live in Austria). (So please forgive all the english-errors I make here.) I can't share BrainStones point of view. When ever you learn English as a foreign language, you don't learn the slang words. No teacher tells his students what \u00bbeating out\u00ab or \u00bbgiving head\u00ab means. When ever words in the field of sexuality are taught in school or in a course for adults, they are clinical and scientific terms. It's even hard to find words like \u00bbboner\u00ab or \u00bbto wank\u00ab in a english-to-foreign-language-dictionary. So when arguing with non-native-speakers, you end up with \u00bbuse clinical terms\u00ab, not with \u00bbuse slang\u00ab.\r\n\r\n**BUT:**  \r\nWhen ever you english is good enough to be able to read and understand Questions and Answers on StackExchange, then you already have found a way to learn slang words and know most of them. (And if you don't know one of them, you have here the chance to learn it.) So in sum it is irrelevant if there are non-native-speakers around."}

Which would make it OK to not bother finding sources for many things, yet if they're challenged, it's up to the original author (or any subsequent editor) to find such sources and present them to back up claims.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think for questions that are fairly basic in nature, citing wikipedia itself is likely sufficient for an also-basic-in-nature answer, which may be all that is needed.\r\n\r\nAnd if a statement is unlikely to be challenged (\"HSV is very common\", say), then in the absence of a challenge, it seems fair game to me to just state it.\r\n\r\nGenerally, though, I'm of the opinion that it's worth holding ourselves to a high standard for verifiability and accuracy.  While this isn't an advice site, people are likely (I imagine, and perhaps hope) to make decisions about their sex lives based in part on answers they find here.  As such, it's best if the answers they find are up to a high standard.\r\n\r\nAs such, to answer your specific questions, I would say yes, a downvote is potentially appropriate - provided it's accompanied by a comment that lets you know what you could do to change it.  And see above for my wordier answer to the second question, but basically: not exactly, but sort of yes.  [See above for longer version of this answer.] \r\n\r\nThat's my take.

I think it's good that we think about what sorts of answers we should most favor on the site.\r\n\r\nI think a few things from [the sex educator training I took][1] may be useful here:\r\n\r\n1. The \"[PLISSIT model][2]\", and in particular the LI part - Limited Information.  Your answer was 2,151 words long, to a question that was 37 words<sup>1</sup>.  Frankly, my eyes glazed over.  It was indeed \"TL;DR\" - I didn't vote, but neither did I read all of it.  As someone prone to giving long-winded answers myself, I've come to realize that sometimes, that's not effective, even if everything you're saying is accurate, correct, and potentially useful to someone.  They need a take-away.  They need something they can digest.  Take-away here: Your answer was too long, and not limited enough in its information.  Even your TL;DR section was longer than the question by a factor of 4<sup>1</sup>.\r\n2. \"Positive-Neutral Tone\" (also fitting in with the P in PLISSIT, which stands for Permission) - combined, these ideas basically say that you want to make it OK for someone to have asked their question (including, on this site, later people who stumble across it from their google searches), while generally giving neutral information. Taking an example from your answer, \"It depends on what the fetish is, whether it causes problems in your life outside of your sexual relations, and a number of other factors.\"  This perhaps takes the neutral too far; a suggested re-phrase, with a bit of positivity might be: \"As long as fetishes aren't causing problems in one's life, they're probably healthy.  When they start interfering with day-to-day life, that's when it might be classified as dysfunction.\"  That's probably not perfect, especially for that question as-asked.  The point I'm trying to make, though, is to give someone something that's just on the positive side of neutral, so they can feel OK about going forward from wherever they are now.\r\n\r\nI could perhaps go on and on about this, but... To do so would counteract the point of my answer.  I've probably already said to much. \r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nFootnote (cited multiple times for the same note on purpose):\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> - not that's _necessarily_ a bad thing, but it's probably a sign that there's a mismatch.  If a question is specifically asking (even in a few words) for a detailed analysis of something, then this sort of discrepancy would make sense. But this question asked two essentially yes/no questions, prefaced with \"Generally speaking\".  So in this case, it wasn't a fit.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://sfsi.org/training/\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLISSIT_model"}

If one is talking about biological sex, male and female may be more appropriate.  Also, the latter words would be more appropriate when used as adjectives, e.g. if referring to testes as \"male gonads\" or ovaries as \"female gonads\" (for whatever reason, I'm aiming for a simple example).\r\n\r\nOf course, *all* of this still resides within a binary construction of sex and gender, and for at least some questions, it would probably be good to be trans*-inclusive as well, by saying things like \"many people with ovaries ...\".\r\n\r\nIf you're speaking of an (adult) individual, whose gender is known (or has reason to be presumed in a hypothetical), I'd go with \"man\" or \"woman\", over \"male\" or \"female\".  But when talking about, say, sexual response cycles (and making a distinction between sexes), I think it's more appropriate to say male or female.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd continue to edit in some cases, but be careful in how you do so.  Hopefully the above serves as a good baseline for a guideline.  Perhaps this can be expanded, too, as needed."}

We should certainly avoid terms with negative or pejorative meanings - cunt, faggot, asshole, dick, and any other term commonly used as an insult - but we also need to avoid being **overly** formal and using obscure words without defining them, because that creates a stilted sex-negative feeling and drives away many readers."}

Suggestions are always welcome, but it is very uncomfortable to have your name attached to something that has been altered in meaning.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify what's going on, you asked a question that depends on opinions, and you - perhaps inadvertently - stepped into an intense ideological battle.  The first answer given was a quote from a blatant example of dishonest science in support of one side.  I was trying to describe some of the background of this debate and to explain why you aren't ever going to be able to get a simple, objective answer to your question. People are just too passionate about it, and at least one side is giving purely ideological answers. (That's all I've seen first hand, but it wouldn't surprise me if the other side is doing it too.)\r\n\r\nIf you asked a question about how women feel about having had an abortion, you would face similar problems about getting objective answers.  If the question you ask is about people's subjective experiences, and the topic is sufficiently politicized, there's no way to get unbiased answers.\r\n\r\nNot everything you see on the Internet is true.  It's not enough to Google something and just paste the results into an answer.  Sometimes you need to know the context in order to evaluate the source, and that's particularly true of highly controversial topics like circumcision and abortion.\r\n\r\nIMHO, it's better to ban subjective questions about those two topics completely.\r\n"}
