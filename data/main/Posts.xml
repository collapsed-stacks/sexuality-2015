There are lots of brothels in Vienna (approximately 100, five of them in the noble inner city-district, one of those in the same block as “Palais Coburg”, the hotel, where some weeks ago US foreign minister John Kerry met Iranian Politicians to talk about the Iranian nuclear strategy). And the prostitutes have places (in the outer districts) where they are allowed by the city government to stand on the street to get picked up by their clients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prostitutes have a special document, where it is reported when they visited the medical officer (they need to visit a medical officer once a week), and this document is checked by police routinely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are 18 years old, you legally can work as a prostitute (in Switzerland you can do it from the age of 16, but until you are 18, you need a paper with a permission signed by your parents). All you have to do is to apply for this document. You will be checked by a medical officer, and if you are healthy, you can legally earn money for offering sex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Sex shops&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In every bigger shopping center, there is at least one sex shop. In Vienna's best known shopping-street (Mariahilferstraße), there are two sex shops (it was four some years ago), and the biggest (“sexworld spartacus”) has two big floors where you can buy any sextoy that you can think of, as well as thousands of porn DVDs and magazines, and it has a porn-cinema with a gay cruising area included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Age of consent&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or take the age of consent (the age of a person that makes it legal for its partner to have sex together). Where I live, it is 14 (it was 12 in most parts of Europe before the 1970ies), but in the USA it is 16, 17 or 18.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Nudist areas&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I give you another example, that from Europe's point of view not really has to do with sexuality, but seems to be linked very strongly to sexuality in North-America: &lt;strong&gt;Nudist areas&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've heard, that in the United states nudist areas are rare, and that they build high fences around nudist areas (I've never been there, people just told me) and that you must be over 18 to be allowed to enter those areas (which means, that there is someone who checks your ID-card).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Through my hometown Vienna flows the river Danube and lots of ships sail on it. In the region of Vienna, this river is split into two riverbeds with an island in-between, that is 21 km long and between 50 and 300 m wide. And at the south-east end of this island is a nudist area, and also on the banks opposite of this part of the island.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there is no fence, and no age-control. There are just the letters “FKK” written on the street, that mark the border of the nudist area:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zk1Ft.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zk1Ft.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Border of a nudist area in Vienna&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;FKK&lt;/strong&gt; is an abbrivation for “&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;rei&lt;strong&gt;k&lt;/strong&gt;örper&lt;strong&gt;k&lt;/strong&gt;ultur”, with is German and literally means “free body culture”. It is the usual German term for being naked in nudist areas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some years ago, I was riding together with some friends, among them a couple from the USA, on bikes along the beautiful bank of the river danube, and so we inevitably had to drive 5 or 6 km through the nudist area, and my American friends couldn't believe all the naked people sunbathing there.

So called from the shape of the pods. European discovery 1521 by Hernando Cortes’ soldiers on reconnaissance in southeastern Mexico. Meaning “flavoring extracted from the vanilla bean” is attested by 1728. Meaning “conventional, of ordinary sexual preferences” is 1970s, from notion of whiteness and the common choice of vanilla ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Etymological dictionaries tend to work in reverse chronological order, as they describe where words &lt;em&gt;come&lt;/em&gt; from. So let’s recast this. A Latin word for a sheath, scabbard, or the hull of a plant was inherited into Spanish, where a diminutive (“little pod”) was applied to a certain plant. That plant name came into English where the meaning was expanded to include the flavouring extracted from the beans of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As this flavouring was the default in ice-cream, it was expanded metaphorically to refer to “conventional” or “ordinary” sexual preferences (i.e., non-BDSM).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From there, the term has expanded to various other meanings of conventional, default, or ordinary. In technological circles, for example, &lt;em&gt;vanilla&lt;/em&gt; means “default, unmodified, standard”. When specifically applied to gaming, for example, it means the default game, without any add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This use of &lt;em&gt;vanilla&lt;/em&gt; to mean “ordinary” is found in all sorts of contexts, but &lt;em&gt;in my personal experience&lt;/em&gt; the two most prevalent contexts are the original (sex) and technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Etymological Sidenote&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the word &lt;em&gt;vanilla&lt;/em&gt; is etymologically related to &lt;em&gt;vagina&lt;/em&gt;, but the derivation is completely unrelated to this usage. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=738&quot;&gt;They developed independently&lt;/a&gt;.

That's one of the reasons waxing is popular. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By removing the hair at the roots, waxing accomplishes a few things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First, it creates an actually-smooth surface. Shaving, much the same way your face works, can leave subble and a rough/coarse texture.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hair regrows with its nominal texture. Remember that what you're doing when you shave anywhere is actually shearing the ends of the hair; that causes them to splinter and feel rough/coarse. Naturally-grown beards can be quite soft; it's usually only after shaving that they begin to feel course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Waxing solves this problem, simply by pulling hair out by its roots. When the entire hair regrows, it has its initial texture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It also fulfills your 'slowest regrowth' requirement.

Some women do it once in a lifetime, but never again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The actual percentage of females who ejaculate is uncertain. However, in Masters and Johnson's famous lab experiments with over 400 women, they did not record anyone who ejaculated at climax.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What research has been done on the fluid?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There hasn't been enough research on the fluid (ejaculate) – partly because it's difficult to obtain adequate supplies of it for investigation. Also, large scientific funds tend to be available for life-threatening diseases rather than for sexual problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, recent research suggests the ejaculate is an alkaline liquid that isn't like urine, because it doesn't contain urea or creatinine, which are normal urinary constituents. The fluid tends to be clear coloured and doesn't stain bedclothes yellow – again, unlike urine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have claimed that it contains some chemical ingredients similar to those produced by the male prostate – notably PSA (prostate-specific antigen). It is also said to contain two sugars: glucose and fructose.&#xA;Since 2000, an increasing number of researchers have suggested the liquid may be the secretion of Skene's glands (the paraurethral glands). These are tiny structures which lie around the female urethra (the urinary pipe).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Viennese researcher Dr Florian Wimpissinger published an important study on two women who habitually ejaculated. (Incidentally, this surname is not some sort of joke! Dr Wimpissinger genuinely is a well-known urologist in Vienna.) He and his colleagues found that the ejaculate from these two females was chemically very different from that of their urine.&#xA;In particular, it contained more prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), more prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and also some glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/seriouslyscience/2015/01/12/proof-female-ejaculation-just-pee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Some other resources' views :-&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Previous experiments ignored the physical source of the copious fluid. But,lately, in 2015, the researchers took it one step further by performing ultrasounds before and after ejaculation, as well as testing the biochemical properties of the liquid. It turned out that not only is it chemically identical to urine, but the bladder emptied during the period of ejaculation coinciding with orgasm. It’s probably just pee after all!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THEIR CONCLUSIONS:&lt;/strong&gt; The present data based on ultrasonographic bladder monitoring and biochemical analyses indicate that squirting is essentially the involuntary emission of urine during sexual activity, although a marginal contribution of prostatic secretions to the emitted fluid often exists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much fluid is produced?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I(not me, the previous source's author) have heard claims that highly-sexed women can produce litres of fluid in a single orgasm.

The risk of these injuries can be reduced by using lubrication. The most common physical problem is simply soreness and possibly minor swelling with it; this should go away after a few days of abstinence. Penile fracture from too much impact is very painful and obvious and you should go to a hospital right away for surgery. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyronie%27s_disease&quot;&gt;Peyronie's disease&lt;/a&gt;, scarring in the penis that causes misshapenness and pain, may be caused by sex or masturbation that is too forceful, but it is not well understood.

Since there is so little reliable information to suggest treatment or prevention, or indeed whether it's something you should really worry about, the only solid advice can be to use common sense: Monitor your own masturbation habits, and cut back if you feel they are becoming unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Masturbating is healthy even if you are also in a sexual relationship. Scientific consensus, such as described by the aforementioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://samples.sainsburysebooks.co.uk/9781317787587_sample_833458.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Masturbation as a Means of Achieving Sexual Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is that masturbation is a healthy part of any sexual life, for example being very useful when your libido and that of your partner are not in sync. Though use of pornography should not be considered evidence of a desire to cheat in a monogamous relationship, some partners may be uncomfortable with it or with masturbation in general, and you will have to decide how important it is to you when negotiating with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A common way you can run into difficulties with masturbation is if you regularly masturbate in an unusual manner that cannot be replicated in sex. Sex &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/archive/columns,savage-love&quot;&gt;columnist&lt;/a&gt; and author Dan Savage &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/columns/savage-love/2015/06/17/22391411/savage-love&quot;&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; that your body gets used to orgasming from the way you masturbate, and if this cannot be replicated in sex then you may have difficulty achieving orgasm. His recommended treatment for this is to spend a month or so masturbating only in the way you'd like to orgasm in sex, and not allowing yourself to orgasm if this is not successful, to encourage your body to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="72" LastEditorUserId="72" LastEditDate="2015-08-01T02:58:32.963" LastActivityDate="2015-08-01T02:58:32.963" CommentCount="0" />

What has the men's genitals to do with female orgasm!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually, female orgasm is a completely different story which depends on how her partner is simulating her. What approaches count are the sensualising methods, the way you're eating out, how warmer and how much comfort you're providing her. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If she won't arouse excitations with you providing orgasm, then no matter what your genitals size is, it won't suffice reaching her orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/womens_health/female_orgasm.php&quot;&gt;This educating guide by Brown University&lt;/a&gt; also nowhere mentions that the size of partner's genitals have any role to play. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quoting them :-&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Most women experience orgasm through clitoral stimulation rather than&#xA;  through vaginal penetration. So if you are having difficulty reaching&#xA;  orgasm with a partner, try clitoral stimulation during, before, or&#xA;  after vaginal intercourse or oral sex. Masturbation can also be an&#xA;  important step in learning to be orgasmic with a partner. Once you&#xA;  have discovered what type of touch and stimulation you enjoy, you will&#xA;  be better able to give your partner(s) helpful directions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If it appeals to you, oral sex can be one of the most effective ways&#xA;  for women to reach orgasm. Having your partner use their mouth and&#xA;  tongue to stimulate the vulva in general and the clitoris in&#xA;  particular can be very arousing and can help you to orgasm. The&#xA;  sensitivity of your vulva and clitoris will determine what type of&#xA;  oral stimulation you enjoy and are most responsive to, so there is no&#xA;  one approach that works for everyone and new partners will need to&#xA;  learn about each other’s bodies and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13" LastEditorUserId="13" LastEditDate="2015-07-29T05:03:32.507" LastActivityDate="2015-07-29T05:03:32.507" CommentCount="2" />

Sperm cells are produced by the testicles, travel down the vas deferens, and mix with the semen, assuming they aren't blocked by a vasectomy or the equivalent.  &lt;em&gt;Semen&lt;/em&gt; - the whitish liquid you ejaculate - is produced primarily in the prostate and the seminal vesicles, with contributions from other glands.  Semen can contain 0-5% sperm by volume. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britannica.com/topic/semen]&quot;&gt;http://www.britannica.com/topic/semen]&lt;/a&gt; But the amount of sperm won't make any difference for the question I think you &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; to ask, which is whether &quot;edging&quot; and non-ejaculatory orgasms are harmful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the answer to that question is no, they are not. The semen remains where it is, waiting for your next ejaculation, just as if you had done nothing to stimulate yourself.  If becoming aroused for extended periods without release did harm, millions of teenage boys would be crippling themselves by making out for hours without release.  And I've personally interviewed two dozen men, including my own partner, who have deliberately had dry orgasms regularly over many years, in some cases for more than 25 years, without any harm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since you asked this in the context of men who are trying to become multi-orgasmic, it's probably worth expanding on that simple &quot;no&quot; answer to include information related to that topic. It starts with the difference between orgasm and ejaculation. Although male orgasms and ejaculation &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; go together, they are not the same thing.  Under certain circumstances men can have an orgasm without an ejaculation, just as boys do before semenarche, and they can have an ejaculation without an orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An orgasm begins in the central nervous system. Within 1-3 seconds of onset, the orgasm triggers the ejaculatory process in the nerves and muscles of the pelvic region, creating waves of muscular contractions that force the semen down the urethra and out.  If you are male, you may recognize the actual onset of the orgasm in your brain as a feeling of inevitability, &quot;the point of no return,&quot; followed moments later by the onset of ejaculation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few men have the ability to suppress the ejaculation signal purely by mental choice. In all cases I know of, these men masturbated to orgasm frequently as boys, before reaching semenarche, and they somehow retained the ability to select which kind of orgasm to have. However, most men who can voluntarily have &quot;dry&quot; (nonejaculatory) orgasms have learned to use a strong, extended  contraction of the pubococcygeal (or &quot;kegel&quot;) muscles just before or at the onset of orgasm to suppress the ejaculation signal. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Note that this actually interrupts the signal and prevents the internal contractions, it does not just block the expulsion of semen. There is a third technique for preventing ejaculation that does involve physically blocking the urethra with fingers or a hard object.  This is entirely different in mechanism and effect, because it does NOT prevent the ejaculatory contractions from taking place.  Instead, these fairly forceful contractions occur, but the semen is physically prevented from moving forward.  As a result, the semen is often forced backward into the bladder (called &quot;retrograde ejaculation&quot;).  Blocking the urethra like this is dangerous and can lead to damage to the urethra or the prostate or both.

A few dabblers in Eastern religion&#xA;  and sexual practices came across clues that this wasn’t necessarily&#xA;  true, but it wasn’t until Alfred Kinsey’s pioneering study, Sexual&#xA;  Behavior in the Human Male, in 1948, that there was a hint that some&#xA;  normal men didn’t follow the supposed rules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Kinsey noted that, out of the thousands of American men he studied, a&#xA;  few reported experiencing orgasm without ejaculation, and being able&#xA;  to have multiple orgasms in a row as a result. Because “everyone knew”&#xA;  that this was impossible, it was largely ignored, or dismissed either&#xA;  as a reporting error or as men simply exaggerating their sexual&#xA;  prowess. The same thing happened in 1966 when Masters and Johnson&#xA;  mentioned the possibility of male orgasms without ejaculation in their&#xA;  landmark book, Human Sexual Response, even though they were relying on&#xA;  laboratory studies, not self-reports or surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In 1978, two researchers published a paper describing interviews with&#xA;  several multi-orgasmic men (M. Robbins, G. Jensen; &quot;Multiple Orgasm in&#xA;  Males,&quot; Journal of Sex Research, vol. 14, no. 1; 1978), but again&#xA;  there was little attention paid to it. It was not until 1984, when&#xA;  William Hartman and Marilyn Fithian published their how-to guide, Any&#xA;  Man Can, that members of the general public became aware that the&#xA;  conventional wisdom was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Hartman and Fithian were among the most respected sex researchers of&#xA;  their era. They recorded extraordinary amounts of data during more&#xA;  than 10,000 hours of observation and recordings of more than 750&#xA;  subjects masturbating and having sex in their Los Angeles lab, still a&#xA;  record in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Among their 282 male subjects, they found 33 who could have anywhere&#xA;  from 2 to 16 orgasms in a row without losing their erections. (Orgasms&#xA;  were defined and determined by recording and measuring the rapid&#xA;  increases in the heart rate and the involuntary contractions of the&#xA;  anal sphincter and pelvic muscles.) These 33 men averaged four orgasms&#xA;  per session, which was typically 20-30 minutes, with the record held&#xA;  by a young man who had 16 consecutive orgasms in less than an hour, an&#xA;  average of less than 4 minutes for each one!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In 1989, Marion Dunn and Jan Trost, researchers in New York, published&#xA;  a study of 21 multiply orgasmic men. They found “&lt;em&gt;that detumescence&#xA;  does not always follow an orgasm, that a nonejaculatory orgasm can&#xA;  occur prior to as well as after an ejaculatory orgasm, and that it is&#xA;  possible to have a series of orgasms. Some of the men reported always&#xA;  having been multiply orgasmic, whereas others experienced it&#xA;  relatively late in life. Others have actively learned to become&#xA;  multiply orgasmic.&lt;/em&gt;” Of these, eight were men who learned to become&#xA;  multi-orgasmic after age 35.  (&quot;Male multiple orgasms: a descriptive&#xA;  study.&quot; Dunn,  Marion E; Trost,  Jan E, Arch Sex Behav. 1989&#xA;  Oct;18(5):377-87.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;edging&quot; process described in the question is commonly used by men who are learning to recognize the onset of orgasm with sufficient accuracy to use the kegel method to control ejaculation.  If you maintain a high level of arousal for too long, it can cause the painful pelvic congestion called &quot;blue balls,&quot; so it's a good idea to continue to the point of ejaculation after an hour or two.  (Experiment to find the time period you find works for you.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Men who use the kegel technique to orgasm without ejaculation typically have a series of dry orgasms followed by an ejaculatory orgasm, so they don't have the pelvic congestion problem.  However, &quot;blue balls&quot; are merely uncomfortable; in spite of what some teenage boys would like girls to believe, they are not actually harmful or dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="228" LastActivityDate="2015-07-30T00:12:53.767" CommentCount="4" />

If an egg has already been released (depending on where you are in your cycle when you take the pill), it may also interfere with the fertilization of the egg.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Morning after pills basically contain a high dose of Progestin, which is the same hormone found in lower doses in birth control pills that are meant to be taken daily. If you plan on having unprotected sex regularly, it's safer (meaning that you will be less likely to become pregnant) if you take regular birth control pills to keep a more constant supply of Progestin in your system, rather than taking a morning after pill every time you have sex. &#xA;(Also, neither of these protect against STDs; they provide protection against pregnancy only).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that if the egg has already been fertilized, and that fertilized egg has had time to implant itself in the woman's uterus, the morning after pill will have no effect. You can take the pill up to 72 hours after having sex, so it doesn't have to be taken &quot;the morning after&quot;, but the sooner the better.

However, like other types of intercourse that the body is not naturally designed for (such as urethral intercourse), it may take some time to actually be able to have anal intercourse without pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Relaxation&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first of two problems has to do with the sphincter muscle. It's basically permanently closed by default, and only after learning to control it can a person will it to allow foreign objects. Normally, this control is only subconscious, like breathing or heart rate, but we can control it to some extent by exercising it regularly. This is done by starting with small objects that are phallus-shaped, such as &quot;sounds&quot;, which are gauged to each increasingly larger sizes as you go up. I recommend using only sanitized toys that are designed for the purpose of sexual exploration, not candles, batteries, pens, or other objects that have other purposes. They can have sharp edges that can cut or stab.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Find a toy that gives an &quot;uncomfortable&quot; feeling, like you really need to defecate, but instead of trying to push it out, focus on letting it stay there. That focus will give you control over the muscle, allowing it to relax. If done right, you'll notice that after a few minutes it seems to be more comfortable. You can experiment fairly safely in the &quot;uncomfortable&quot; zone without harm. Once that toy is like second nature, you can move up to the next &quot;uncomfortable&quot; size. I'd suggest at least fifteen minutes at each level before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that after a few minutes of playing with an object that &quot;barely fits&quot;, will slide in and out without any problems once your body has accommodated for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Stretching&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other important factor is that the entire region has a lining much like skin. If you stretch it too quickly, you'll create a tear, which causes bleeding, hemorrhaging, and other unpleasant side effects. A severe enough tear will need medical attention, and you'll have to explain what you were doing. I'm pretty sure the ER doctors don't want to have to explore a rectum any more than you want to have it explored with surgical tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like other body parts, such as skin, earlobes, and the urethra, you can slowly stretch this body part out over time. By stretching it just to the point where it feels very uncomfortable, but not painful (it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like its stretching), you're actually creating micro-tears in the tissue. This is permanent &quot;damage,&quot; and will heal quickly, but the tissue will be permanently larger than it was before. As you can imagine, you can continue to create micro-tears, allowing several days for healing between each attempt, to allow nearly unbelievable stretching. See &quot;goatse&quot; on Google Images, and you'll see what I'm talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you're experimenting with increasing size, pay attention to the feeling. There's the uncomfortable bit of of allowing the muscles to relax, and there's a completely different feeling of stretching when you're at your physical limit. That stretching must be done carefully, and in a controlled manner, or you'll cause some serious damage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Myths: Incontinence&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may have heard that anal stretching and/or intercourse leads to incontinence later in life. The two events appear largely uncorrelated by most serious studies, as the sphincter will generally do its job of holding feces in until you let loose-- if it was going to happen, it was going to happen anyways, regardless of any stretching you may have done earlier in life. The muscle generally &quot;grows old&quot; and fails to do its job as well as it used to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Myths: Pain&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many people will say that anal intercourse must have some pain because you're rubbing nerves the wrong way. This simply isn't true. Those nerves are telling you that you're doing damage you'll regret later when you feel pain. Normally, you should simply feel &quot;like you have to go&quot;, which means the nerves are simulated, but not in any actual danger of damage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anal intercourse can be pleasurable for both partners if done with patience and love. It will take weeks, months, or even years, depending on the initial condition of the anus involved and the size (particularly girth) of the penis being inserted, before it can be attempted without pain, but after enough experience, anal intercourse can even be done with nothing more than precum or a single drop of lubricant, and a few minutes of playing around.

Like all muscles, it gets stronger when exercised regularly, weaker if it's not exercised regularly, can be &quot;trained&quot; like other muscles, and can be damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If damaged from extreme abuse (including possibly child birth), the vagina may never be able to contract as tight as it used to.

Generally speaking, with proper care and exercise, there's no reason why a vagina that is fisted regularly will not eventually reach normal size after a period of inactivity. The same thing occurs after a period of sexual inactivity, where it takes significant more lube/patience/effort to have intercourse after taking a break for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming no pain was involved in the fisting, and the vagina is youthful enough to recover, the vagina should eventually bounce back to its smaller self.

Avoid contact with people you don't know well, don't trust well, or are known to be high risk takers. If you haven't had the HPV vaccination, do get it, as it may very well save your life. Also, obviously, don't have sexual contact with anyone that has any symptoms or have ever been known to have symptoms.

The FC2 is a soft, flexible nitrile tube with two retainer rings.  The smaller one holds the closed end of the tube inside while the larger one keeps the open end outside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The FC2 is just okay as a vaginal condom, but where it really stars is in anal sex.  Whether you're using toys, fingers, or penis, using the FC2 is much more sanitary and much more enjoyable than going bare.  It's also much less likely to get lost inside the rectum than a regular condom. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When used for full penile penetration, the friction is between his penis and the lubricated inside of the FC2, instead of being between the condom and the recipient's anus/rectum, which is much harder to lubricate properly.  So both people get more pleasure with the FC2 and the &quot;bottom&quot; is protected against abrasion and pain from being underlubed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can't use a regular condom and an FC2 at the same time, but if you're an M/F couple with clean tests and you're using something other than condoms for birth control, one of the greatest things about the FC2 is that it lets you switch back and forth between anal and vaginal penetration without having to stop to sanitize fingers or cocks, so it gives you much more flexibility and lets long sex sessions be much more spontaneous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More details and tips &lt;a href=&quot;http://moderntantra.blogspot.com/2015/01/mailbag-5-tantra-for-women-and-fc2-for.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="228" LastActivityDate="2015-08-01T18:09:31.000" CommentCount="1" />

I've talked to women who rave about anal.  There's anecdotal and web-survey evidence that orgasms are more likely to happen among women who like anal a lot, but no way to tell which way causality runs.  But in my interviews with long-term couples, only a quarter of the women like full anal penetration, and that seems to be fairly typical of other surveys that screen out the cases of &quot;I tried it once and it hurt like crazy, so never again!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing I've noticed is that women who rave about anal orgasms are almost never doing &lt;strong&gt;just&lt;/strong&gt; anal penetration.  The sessions they describe usually begin with extensive clitoral, vaginal, and anal stimulation, frequently including multiple orgasms, before penile penetration of the anus begins.  In most cases, the clitoral stimulation also continues &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; the anal penetration.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, a friend of mine starts with a series of orgasms from oral and manual stimulation of her clit, labia, vaginal opening, and anus by her generous and talented husband.  When she's ready for the big finale, she lies face down with a thick cushion under her hips and the head of a &quot;Magic Wand&quot; vibrator between her clit and the cushion. Her husband slowly inserts his penis in her anus and then strokes to completion while she grinds her vulva on the vibrator.  This generally triggers a sustained rapid-fire series of orgasms for her that starts as soon as he enters her, lasts until he finishes, and is longer and more intense than what she can get from any other kind of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of men love doing penetrative anal, and some really like being the receiver.  Even more like being fingered and receiving prostate massage.  Some describe the latter, in particular, in language that sounds as ecstatic as the language some women use when they are super-enthusiastic about anal or anal/clitoral orgasms. But, as with most things sexual, men describe a shorter period of peak pleasure than women do, and lab studies seem to confirm that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think there's any way we'll ever prove which gender has more pleasure from any kind of sex.  However, my completely unprovable hunch is that the same two rules apply to anal as to most kinds of sex:  On the average, women enjoy it less, just because bad sex is bad for women and mostly okay for men.  On the other hand, at the extreme of greatest pleasure, women enjoy great sex more, or at least enjoy it just as much for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="228" LastEditorUserId="228" LastEditDate="2015-08-02T06:12:29.120" LastActivityDate="2015-08-02T06:12:29.120" CommentCount="0" />

And each of those erections can last between 15 and 40 minutes (sometimes even longer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only when you suffer from an &lt;em&gt;erectile dysfunction&lt;/em&gt;, you can't get nightly erections. And a very simple test on &lt;em&gt;erectile dysfunction&lt;/em&gt; uses this fact: Stick some stamps around your penis when going to sleep. The nightly erections will tear apart the stamps, which proofs, that you can get erections. If the stamps aren't torn apart, the chance is high that you have a medical problem that makes it impossible to get an erection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the test on &lt;em&gt;erectile dysfunction&lt;/em&gt; see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumescence&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumescence&lt;/a&gt; section “&lt;em&gt;Nocturnal penile tumescence testing&lt;/em&gt;”, item 2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The reason is dreaming&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The simple reason for the nightly erections is: &lt;strong&gt;dreaming&lt;/strong&gt;. When you have a dream, not only your eyes are moving fast (REM = rapid eye movement). Also your heart is beating faster and the frequency of breath increases. But still your body lays there very comfortable and relaxed--the best conditions for the blood to flow into the penis and build up an erection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter what you are dreaming of. A dream with sexual content doesn't produce a harder or longer erection than any other dream. Only when the dream is a nightmare, where you have strong negative emotions, are you unlikely to get an erection, because your body is not as relaxed during a nightmare as during a normal dream.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;see also: &lt;a href=&quot;http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=488693&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cycle of Penile Erection Synchronous With Dreaming (REM) Sleep&lt;/a&gt; (scientific paper)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;“Wet” dreams&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you didn't ejaculate for a longer period of time, it can happen that during one of those dreams even semen is emitted, but without having an orgasm. (This depends on how you define “male orgasm”. When you say &lt;em&gt;male orgasm = emission of semen&lt;/em&gt;, then you have an orgasm per definition, otherwise not.) When you wake up and see what happened, many people think it was because of a sexual dream (which in fact is very likely), but it can also happen while dreaming of something very different. So a &lt;em&gt;“wet” dream&lt;/em&gt; (“&lt;em&gt;nocturnal emission&lt;/em&gt;” in doctor-speach) often really is a sexual dream, but not always. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See also this article in Young Men's Health about &lt;a href=&quot;http://youngmenshealthsite.org/guides/wet-dreams/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nocturnal emissions (“wet” dreams)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;“Morning wood” = last nightly erection&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The longer you are sleeping, the more likely it is that you are dreaming (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep#Timing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Timing of REM-sleep&lt;/a&gt; in Wikipedia). You don't dream really much during the fist few hours of sleeping, but in the hours before you wake up, you have more dreams. And so, this is also the time where you have more erections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you wake up during a dream, or short after a dream, it is very likely that you wake up while having one of those nightly erections, so the “morning wood” is just the last nightly erection of a night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;btw: When talking about dreams, you should know that your brain erases memories on dreams very quickly. So many people can't remember their dreams. Many even don't remember that they did dream at all, but the fact is that every person is dreaming every night. If you really don't dream you a have very serious medical problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Men only?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also interesting to know:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Under the same situations where sleeping men get an erection, a woman will get a wet vagina, the clitoris will rise and the labia will bulge. So women wake up with the symptoms of sexual arousal as often as men, but since there in fact is no real arousal, and since those anatomic changes are not so visible on women as an men, the female counterpart of male “morning wood” is widely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the resources linked above, here are also some resources in German language (my native language).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internisten-im-netz.de/de_news_6_0_448_n-chtliche-erektionen-auch-ohne-erotische-tr-ume.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Erektion auch ohne erotische Träume&lt;/a&gt; written my a medical doctor who is a specialist for internal medicine on a website that is specialized on internal medicine.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netdoktor.de/Gesund-Leben/Sex+Partnerschaft/Sexualitaet/Morgendliche-Erektion-3340.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Morgendliche Erektion&lt;/a&gt; article on general medical website, written by a gynecologist  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A4chtliche_Erektion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nächtliche Erektion&lt;/a&gt; German wikipedia article about morning erections.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="115" LastEditorUserId="64" LastEditDate="2015-08-06T18:36:58.953" LastActivityDate="2015-08-06T18:36:58.953" CommentCount="0" />

Genital herpes (HSV-2) is substantially more aggravating, but rarely life-threatening.

You may be infected with HSV-1&#xA;  or HSV-2 but not show any symptoms. Often symptoms are triggered by&#xA;  exposure to the sun, fever, menstruation, emotional stress, a weakened&#xA;  immune system, or an illness. There is no cure for herpes, and once&#xA;  you have it, it is likely to come back. However, some people may have&#xA;  one outbreak and then never have another one.

The old high-dose pill increased risks of some cancers, especially for smokers, but even the high-dose pill has not shown any sign of harming adolescent development.  Modern IUDs and implants, with their very low dosage levels are quite probably not just harmless in this regard, but actually somewhat beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To understand why, you need to consider how unnatural the internal hormonal environment is for modern teens.  Most of human physiology evolved long before herding and agricultural, more than ~10,000 years ago.  In that nomadic forager environment, women were usually pregnant, nursing, or half starved, all three of which shut down the cycle.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The typical girl back then started puberty at 11 or 12, hit menarche at around 16, had perhaps 10-15 periods before getting pregnant at 18 or 19.  After the baby was born, ovulation was usually suppressed while she nursed for ~4 years or until the baby died. Then she had a few more menstrual periods and got pregnant again.  Rinse and repeat until she died or reached menopause.  All told, she probably had less than 60 periods spread out over 30+ years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, a young girl today may begin puberty at 7, start menstruating at 10, and have a hundred periods by age 18. That's more than a lifetime's worth of strong hormonal fluctuations starting much earlier than it &quot;should,&quot; while the brain and endocrine system are much less mature.  Today, if a woman has one or two kids and doesn't breastfeed for long, she may well have &lt;em&gt;400-500 periods&lt;/em&gt; in 40+ years, something her system was never designed for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just because something evolved doesn't mean it's benign, especially when the circumstances change that much.  The human menstrual cycle is uniquely nasty and damaging.  It is the product of a bizarre three-way arms race between the conflicting interests of mothers, fathers, and fetuses.  Like many arms races, it produced a wasteful and dysfunctional outcome that is not to the benefit of any side.  And modern high-calorie diets and sedentary lives make it worse by triggering the process much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many scientists believe that suppressing or mitigating most of those hormonal cycles is beneficial, particularly for girls and young women.  The pill, if taken continuously, eliminates the monthly cycle and creates a hormonal environment more like pregnancy, giving the woman's system some rest from hormonal fluctuations. Low-dose IUDs and implants very gently suppress ovulation, reducing the strength of the cycles and often stopping menstruation after a year or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; form of birth control is safer than teen pregnancy, which is still a major health and mortality risk for girls. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I had teenage daughters, I'd want them on Implanon, the low-hormone implant. (The IUD would be a close second.) Nothing in life is ever completely risk-free, but in this case the best and safest methods of birth control are so much less risky than the alternatives, &lt;em&gt;including&lt;/em&gt; the risk of doing nothing, that I think that choice should be a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: There's been plenty of time for even subtle harm to show up in terms of adolescent development and hormonal contraception, and none has been detected; in addition, there are some reasons to think that reducing the number and severity of hormone fluctuations is beneficial, especially for adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ref:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drugwatch.com/2013/04/16/iud-birth-control-study-focuses-on-teens/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IUD Birth Control Like Mirena and Skyla Are Safe for Teens, Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the underlying study:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;CONCLUSIONS: The IUD is as appropriate for teenagers to use as it is&#xA;  for older women, with serious complications occurring infrequently in&#xA;  all groups.

Your husband is causing the problems, not you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;The Technical Data:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are at least two medical terms for blueballs:  &quot;Testicular Vasocongestion&quot; and &quot;Epididymal Hypertension&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/epididymal-hypertension-blue-balls&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; found on the University of California at Santa Barbara website:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What Causes Epididymal Hypertension?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When a man becomes sexually aroused, the arteries that carry blood to his genitals enlarge, while the veins that leave the genital area constrict, allowing less blood to escape. This uneven rate of blood flow increases the quantity and pressure of blood flow and traps it in the genital area. This pressure is responsible for producing an erection and making the testes swell to be 25-50% larger than their normal size. If an orgasm is achieved, the blood vessels will return to their normal size and the volume of blood in the genitals quickly returns to its normal level. By contrast, if a man does not have an orgasm, blood in the genitals builds up through a process called vasogongestion and may create sensations of heaviness, aching, or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Epididymal hypertension usually does not last long and often the pain associated with blue balls is minor.  Many men may become frustrated when they get an erection during sexual activity, but do not achieve orgasm. This frustration and failure to ejaculate can add psychological stress to physical discomfort, making blue balls seem even worse. Men who feel pressure to ejaculate every time that they are aroused may attempt to coerce an unwilling partner into participating in sexual activity leading to his own climax.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How is Epididymal Hypertension Treated?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The simplest remedy for blue balls is orgasm and ejaculation. Masturbation is often the most viable way to achieve this orgasm, especially if one's partner does not want to have sex. Testicular pain may dissipate slowly after orgasm, or on its own once the individual is no longer aroused. Realizing that ejaculation is not a requirement for all sexual situations can help partners become more comfortable together and experience better sexual intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neilbaum.wordpress.com/2013/05/12/blue-balls-sex-and-painful-testicles/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; of a Urologist named Dr. Neil Baum:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Blue Balls-Sex and Painful Testicles&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Blue balls are not just a figment of a male’s imagination or a lame excuse to try and get you in the sack. Though it doesn’t happen to all men, it is a very real condition that results from a prolonged state of sexual arousal. When a guy is physically turned on, blood flows to his penis, which is what gives him an erection, which is a good thing, and his testicles, causing them to swell, not such a good thing! If he doesn’t ejaculate, there is a buildup of pressure, and his supersensitive testicles start to hurt. The sensation can range from a mild ache to worse-than-getting-kicked-in-the-crotch pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: &lt;strong&gt;Blue balls are not dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;, and a young man can resolve it. The easiest solution is for the man to masturbate as an orgasm and ejaculation will cause the congestion in the penis and scrotum to abate. Just as the erection will subside after an ejaculation, the congestion around the testicles will also subside and the pain will go away. If the young man has an aversion to masturbation, then just waiting it out is also a solution as the blood will eventually drain, and any discomfort will disappear on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another entry from Dr. Baum:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men who believe that they should ejaculate every time they have an erection &lt;em&gt;are likely to exert pressure on their partner to proceed with sex without taking her feelings into consideration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Some men find that masturbation is a viable solution and are realizing that ejaculation is not a requirement in every sexual situation. This attitude allows both men and their partners to relax more and to learn that pleasure and meaning can exist without having to reach ejaculation and orgasm during every sexual encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Are You Doing Something Wrong?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not.  If your husband is anything like me, it takes a lot to cause blueballs.  If you're being candid with him and letting him know that you're not in the mood, he should stop doing the things that lead to blueballs.  In my own experience, it was much easier to get blueballs when I was a teenager ravaged by his own hormones.  Now that I'm an adult, it is much more difficult to get blueballs.  The last time it happened, I had been &quot;dry humping&quot; for an hour or more.  The point is this:  He doesn't just get blueballs at the drop of a hat.  He has to work at it for a significant amount of time before he's at risk of blueballs.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This being the case, and assuming that you are being open and honest about not wanting to have sex, the blame for his blueballs lies squarely on his own shoulders.  He did it to himself.  I don't want to make any wild assumptions, but it seems that if you're telling him that you aren't in the mood, and he is still managing to give himself blueballs, he is probably pushing way too hard, and not listening to what you're saying.  If a woman told me that she didn't want to have sex, I would accept it and move on.  I certainly wouldn't keep dry humping her, especially not for so long that I got blueballs.  You might want to tell your husband to pay more attention to what &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; want and don't want.  The fact that he &quot;feels guilty&quot; after the fact is no excuse, and it doesn't change the fact that he was ignoring your desires and needs.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't worry too much about your husband's suffering, because it is temporary and probably not as serious as menstrual pains, but especially because he should be able to control how worked up he lets himself become.  If you are being forthcoming about not being in the mood, and he still gets himself all hot and bothered, he has only himself to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, you aren't to blame for your husband's apparent lack of self control, and in any case, there are no long term health effects related to frequent blueball episodes.  It's no more serious than any other situational pain not caused by an actual injury.  It is very uncomfortable, but not really harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Note:  I'm hesitant to say this, because as I have already said, under no circumstances should anyone ever try to coerce, cajole, or guilt trip someone into having sex against their will, and by the same token, &lt;em&gt;you aren't obligated to do anything to prevent your husband from getting himself so excited that he ends up with blueballs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;However, I don't think it is going too far to say this:  &lt;strong&gt;The most you can do is to make sure he knows when he isn't going to get any, so he doesn't get himself all riled up&lt;/strong&gt;.  But again, it isn't your responsibility to make sure he doesn't get carried away.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2015-08-04T02:39:21.590" LastActivityDate="2015-08-04T02:39:21.590" CommentCount="0" />

Sex is ideally supposed to be intimate, and in my own experience, it is best when there is a strong bond between the parties involved.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I might be playing devil's advocate here, but it seems to me that if you aren't comfortable &lt;em&gt;talking&lt;/em&gt; about a sexual act with your significant other, it is at least possible that you should reconsider your desire to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; the thing that you can't even talk about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are sure you are ready for it, and that your partner is important enough to you to make it a good idea, it should be relatively easy to discuss it with him or her.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; to Do:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original wording of your question raised some red flags for me, because you said you wanted to &quot;convince&quot; your partner to perform fellatio, which makes it sound like the other person isn't entirely willing to do it.  If you start the conversation with your significant other from a position of trying to persuade them, you might have some trouble.  Being cajoled or harangued into doing something is not a pleasant experience, and even if you succeeded in &quot;convincing&quot; him or her to perform fellatio, he or she wouldn't enjoy it as much as he or she could have if there was no pressure involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What You &lt;em&gt;Might&lt;/em&gt; Want to Do:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would suggest that you simply sit down with your partner and talk about what you are interested in doing with him or her.  If you do so in a respectful manner, showing your sympathy for him or her, and making it clear that you respect their wishes and reservations about it, you should do well.  As long as you stick to a respectful and understanding frame of mind, the worst that can happen is that your partner says &quot;no&quot;, which is, of course, his or her prerogative.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could try to instigate oral sex during your next encounter with your partner.  It is frequently the case that some people who are embarrassed or intimidated by the idea of engaging in certain sexual acts find it easier to overcome their hesitation when they are in the heat of the moment, so to speak, and especially if they &lt;strong&gt;receive&lt;/strong&gt; the sexual act before they have to perform it, rather than having to &quot;go first&quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  If you start the process by offering to perform fellatio or cunnilingus on your significant other, he or she may find the prospect of returning the favor less embarrassing or intimidating.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What if the Answer is &quot;No&quot;:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The most important thing to remember is that, should your partner say &quot;no&quot; to the idea of performing fellatio, you have to accept it and move on.  At some later date, he or she may change his or her mind, but you have no right to try to force him or her to do something he or she doesn't want to do.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;On a side note, I know that the situation varies from one place to another, as well as from one person to the next, but in my personal experience, very few people today find fellatio &quot;disgusting&quot;, especially among the younger generation, who grew up with the interwebs and all the sexual content that comes with it.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sub&gt;This should not be taken to mean that someone who has just received a sexual favor is obliged to return it.  I am merely saying that if someone is reluctant to perform a sexual act because they are embarrassed or intimidated by the prospect, the embarrassment and intimidation may be lessened by having someone perform the same act first, thereby making it less of a big deal.  The same idea applies to the people hired by nightclubs to start dancing as soon as the club opens.  People are often reluctant to be the first person to do something that could be considered embarrassing, especially if they think they'll be the only person doing it;  this is why it is much harder to be the first person on the dance floor than it is to be the 40th person on the dance floor.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2015-08-03T04:58:14.397" LastActivityDate="2015-08-03T04:58:14.397" CommentCount="0" />

There is nothing wrong with being turned on by clowns, or feet, or people dressed in mascot costumes, or reasonable amounts of BDSM, or whatever else you like, as long as it doesn't result in or involve any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criminal activity (obviously, this doesn't apply to LGBTQ people who happen to live in an area where homosexuality is criminalized - it is limited to things like pedophilia, nonconsensual exhibitionism, frotteurism, and voyeurism, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious bodily harm or emotional trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interference with social relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The involvement of nonconsenting people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;When Does a Fetish Become a Problem?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a complicated issue, and to address it, we need to look at the diagnostic criteria psychologists and psychiatrists use.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These definitions, diagnostic criteria, and descriptions are contained in a book called the DSM, or the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychological Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're not comfortable with the clinical terminology, you can ignore the words &quot;diagnostic criteria&quot; and imagine that it says &quot;definition&quot;.   That's what we're really interested in here:  when is a fetish &lt;em&gt;defined&lt;/em&gt; as a paraphiliac disorder?&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;What is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychological Association?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my answer, I will refer to the definitions of paraphilias as described in the DSM, and I will do so at considerable length. For those who don't know, the DSM is the book psychologists and psychiatrists use to diagnose mental illnesses.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The version of the DSM I own is the DSM-IV, or in other words, the fourth edition of the DSM.  The DSM-IV is now outdated, but only slightly, because the fifth edition, or DSM-V, was recently published.  Since I only have access to the DSM-IV, I will have to rely on it.  As I understand it, the portions of the DSM which we are interested in here have not been substantially revised in the fifth edition, so this shouldn't be a problem.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;The Complete Answer:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why Should We Pay Attention to the DSM?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because &quot;dysfunction&quot; and &quot;disorder&quot; are technical terms, and they describe specific medical conditions.  If you wanted to know the answer to a question like &quot;What is cancer?&quot;, you would ask a doctor or other medical professional.  If you wanted to know what a carburetor is, you would ask a mechanic.  We're talking about psychological disorders, so we need to ask what psychologists and psychiatrists say about it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book psychologists and psychiatrists use to identify and diagnose mental illnesses is the DSM.  Therefore, there is no better place to turn for information about this subject than the DSM.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How Does the DSM Work?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, the DSM describes a given condition, then the criteria by which the condition is diagnosed, then provides the diagnostic codes, and in some cases, lists variations on the primary condition.  It also provides statistical data on each of the conditions described, such as how common the condition is, how many people with a given condition fall into different categories, and so on.  It does not explain how these conditions should be treated.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Very broadly, the diagnostic criteria include things like the duration of the condition, what effects the condition has on different aspects of the patient's daily life, and sometimes, a list of possible symptoms is provided.  Most of the time, and with most conditions, a formal diagnosis requires that the patient meet a certain number of criteria.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, a diagnosis of &quot;Major Depressive Episode&quot;, commonly referred to as a bout of depression, requires that the patient report at least five out of 9 possible symptoms, and that the symptoms persist for at least two weeks.  In addition, the diagnosis requires that the symptoms are not better explained by another diagnosis, that they are not the result of a medical condition or drug, and that they are not the result of reasonable mood changes related to normal upsetting events like bereavement at the loss of a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that we know how the DSM is supposed to be used, we can turn to the subject at hand.  For the sake of brevity, I can't describe the diagnostic criteria for every sexual fetish treated as a disorder.  Therefore, I will provide a single example, discuss it at length, and try to summarize the rest of the information as best I can.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it makes sense to focus on the paraphilia&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; described as Sexual Masochism Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What Does the DSM Say About Sexual Masochism Disorder?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The DSM lists &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_masochism_disorder&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sexual Masochism Disorder&lt;/a&gt; as a mental illness, and has done so since the late 60's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_masochism_disorder&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;entry&lt;/a&gt; on Sexual Masochism Disorder:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sexual masochism disorder is the condition of experiencing recurring and intense sexual arousal in response to enduring extreme pain, suffering, or humiliation.  It may occur either with or without asphyxiophilia, the experience of sexual arousal from restricted breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization broadly agrees with this assessment:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sadomasochism appears in the current version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization.  It refers to the “preference for sexual activity that involves bondage or the infliction of pain or humiliation” (p. 172), and divides sadomasochism into masochism and sadism according to whether the individual prefers to be the recipient or provider of it. The ICD-10 specifies that mild forms of sadomasochism “are commonly used to enhance otherwise normal sexual activity” (p. 172), and that the diagnosis would apply only if the behavior is preferred or required for sexual gratification. The condition is classified as one of the disorders of sexual preference, which includes the paraphilias (p. 170).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The relevant page of the DSM-IV, showing the description of the condition:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/6YSHi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/6YSHi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;It is important to note that this does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean that anyone who enjoys BDSM is dysfunctional, nor does it mean that there is anything wrong with enjoying BDSM.

Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving the act (real, not simulated) of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;B.  The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Differential Diagnosis&quot; part of the chapter on paraphilias describes what is meant by criterion B, &lt;strong&gt;and since criterion B is part of the diagnosis of &lt;em&gt;every single paraphiliac disorder&lt;/em&gt;, understanding this is very important for the purposes of this question&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A paraphilia must be distinguished from the &lt;strong&gt;nonpathological use of sexual fantasies, behaviors, or objects as a stimulus for sexual excitement&lt;/strong&gt; in individuals without a paraphilia.  Fantasies, behaviors, or objects are paraphiliac only when they lead to clinically significant distress or impairment (e.g., are obligatory, result in sexual dysfunction, require participation of nonconsenting individuals, lead to legal complications, interfere with social relationships).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  [emphasis in the original text]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What Other Fetishes are Listed as Paraphilias in the DSM?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other sexual fetishes listed as psychological disorders within the category of paraphilias in the DSM are as follows&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual Sadism (&quot;inflicting humiliation or suffering&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transvestic Fetishism (&quot;cross dressing&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voyeurism (&quot;observing sexual activity&quot;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fetishism (&quot;use of nonliving objects&quot;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pedophilia (&quot;focus on prepubescent children&quot;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frotteurism (&quot;touching and rubbing against a nonconsenting person&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exhibitionism (&quot;exposure of genitals&quot;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified (...&quot;Paraphilias that do not meet the criteria for any of the specific categories.  Examples include, but are not limited to, telephone scatologia (obscene phone calls), necrophilia (corpses), partialism (exclusive focus on part of the body), zoophilia (animals), coprophilia (feces), klismaphilia (enemas), and urophilia (urine).&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The criteria for diagnosing the paraphilias listed above are broadly similar to the criteria for diagnosing Sexual Masochism Disorder, although the terms of the criteria are obviously tailored to the specific behaviors, fantasies, and sexual urges associated with the paraphilia in question.  The duration criteria is always &quot;at least 6 months&quot;, and in every case, it is necessary for the fantasies, behaviors, or sexual urges to &quot;cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot;.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How Do Fetishes Start?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We don't really know.  As the previous answer said, there hasn't been much research on the subject.  The DSM confirms this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Although paraphilias are rarely diagnosed in general clinical facilities, the large commercial market in paraphiliac pornography and paraphernalia suggests that its prevalence in the community is likely to be much higher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it seems that paraphiliac fetishes often begin early in life:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Certain of the fantasies and behaviors associated with paraphilias may begin in childhood or early adolescence but become better defined and elaborated during adolescence and early adulthood.  Elaboration and revision of paraphiliac fantasies may continue over the lifetime of the individual...  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The disorders tend to be chronic and lifelong, but both the fantasies and the behaviors often diminish with advancing age in adults.  The behaviors may increase in response to psychosocial stressors, in relation to other mental disorders, or with increased opportunity to engage in the paraphilia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What Makes Paraphiliac (i.e., Dysfunctional) Fetishes Different From Other Fetishes?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most fetishes are harmless.  Paraphiliac fetishes are not.  The &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic Features&lt;/em&gt; section of the chapter on paraphilias sums up the difference very well.  I have added line breaks and emphasis for the sake of clarity and readability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paraphiliac imagery may be acted out with a &lt;em&gt;nonconsenting&lt;/em&gt; partner in a way that may be injurious to the partner&lt;/strong&gt; (as in Sexual Sadism or Pedophilia). &lt;strong&gt;The individual may be subject to arrest and incarceration&lt;/strong&gt;.  Sexual offenses against children constitute a significant proportion of all reported criminal sex acts, and individuals with Exhibitionism, Pedophilia, and Voyeurism make up the majority of apprehended sex offenders.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In some situations, acting out the paraphiliac imagery may lead to self-injury&lt;/strong&gt; (as in Sexual Masochism).  &lt;strong&gt;Social and sexual relationships may suffer&lt;/strong&gt; if others find the unusual sexual behavior shameful or repugnant or if the individual's sexual partner refuses to cooperate in the unusual sexual preferences. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In some instances, the unusual behavior (e.g., exhibitionist acts or the collection of fetish objects) may become the major sexual activity in the individual's life.  &lt;strong&gt;These individuals are rarely self-reported and usually come to the attention of mental health professionals only when their behavior has brought them into conflict with sexual partners or society.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  [Emphasis mine] &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Summary:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;In general, for a paraphilia to be considered a psychological disorder,  it must persist for at least 6 months, and it must &quot;cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot;.  It is also important to say that the overwhelming majority of fetishes are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; considered to be indicative of dysfunction, and are certainly not considered to be actual disorders.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footnotes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The DSM defines paraphilia as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[R]ecurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors generally involving 1) Nonhuman objects, 2) the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one's partner, or 3) children or other nonconsenting persons, that occur over a period of at least 6 months (Criterion A).  For some individuals, paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli are obligatory for erotic arousal and are always included in sexual activity.  In other cases, the paraphiliac preferences occur only episodically (e.g., perhaps during periods of stress), whereas at other times the person is able to function sexually without paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli.  The behavior, sexual urges, or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion B).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The quotes in parentheses are the brief summary descriptions given in the DSM.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The more thorough description goes into more detail.  The paraphilia is specifically related to: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;the act of observing an &lt;strong&gt;unsuspecting&lt;/strong&gt; person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  [Emphasis mine]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; There is an additional criterion for Fetishism:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The nonliving objects are not limited to articles of female clothing used in cross-dressing (as in Transvestic Fetishism) or devices designed for the purpose of tactile genital stimulation (e.g., a vibrator).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;In the case of Pedophilia too, there is an additional criterion:  the patient must be at least 16 years old, and at least 6 years older than the child or children whom the patient is fantasizing about, having sexual urges towards, or engaging in sexual behaviors.  It also requires that the diagnosing physician record which gender(s) the patient is attracted to; whether the attraction is limited to incest;  and whether the patient is exclusively attracted to children, or also attracted to adults.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;The criteria for Exhibitionism specify that the person to whom the patient exposes his or her genitals must be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;an unsuspecting stranger&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2015-08-04T22:13:15.607" LastActivityDate="2015-08-04T22:13:15.607" CommentCount="0" />

And during sleep even toddlers get nightly erections (“nocturnal penile tumescence”). So it is absolutely normal that boys also get erections when they are awake. The body of every healthy boy is capable of producing an erection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When not during the period of sleep, this very often goes together with manual stimulation, from simply touching up to fully masturbation, even in very young years. I remember that I masturbated when I was 5, probably I did it before, but I have no memories of those early days. And when I was 7, I learned from my classmates, that they did the same, and some of them also had those 90°-erections. Many years ago I also talked with two nurses (teachers of 3- to 6-year-old kids) (independently from each other), who also said, that they often have seen masturbation even by 3-year-old boys and girls, and both women said that this is not rare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I also have heard of many adult men who pretend to never have had erections as a prepubescent boy. The first few times I heard this, I thought they were lying, because one might think this could have something to do with sexual abuse, but since then I've heard this so often that now I really believe that there are men who really never had erections before puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to answer your question “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do erections occur in&lt;/em&gt; all &lt;em&gt;prepubescent males?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Yes, they do at least occur in all healthy prepubescent males when they are sleeping.

I guess (but am not absolutely sure), that at some boys before puberty, this ligament is too long to fix the erected penis in the upright position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BTW: When the penis is limp, this ligament holds it up too. So there is a method of penis-“enlargement”, where this rope is cut through. So when the limp penis hangs down, now it hangs down further and therefore looks longer.

So in those times it was not just only normal to be gay, gay men even was seen as some kind of “better” or “nobler” men. No wonder, that in those times the percentage of men claiming to be gay, was very high.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in mediaeval times, or in Nazi-Germany, homosexuals have been killed for being gay or lesbian. So almost nobody dared to confess his/her homosexuality.

Imagining two women, one with a regular menstrual cycle lasting 27 days, and another of 29 days, there will be times when the cycles appear to converge. This can be modeled with a simple pair of sine waves; see, e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=sin(27x),sin(29x)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.google.com/search?q=sin(27x),sin(29x)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Add that to our tendency to notice the things that do synchronize (or more generally, that seem noteworthy) more intensely than the the things that don't (or seem uninteresting), and it's easy to imagine why this might continue to get reported, even if it's only a relatively rare and temporary effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if two women were to start taking birth control pills or using the ring on the same day, they might well then have a regular 28 day cycle as long as they're both using such methods, which would be an artificial way to create such synchronization. This happens because the hormones being put into the body are on a cycle, and the cycle is deliberately controlled.  Birth control pills are typically administered in a way that provides hormones for 21 days, and then none for 7 days (either by not taking pills, or by taking pills that don't have hormone in them), and the ring is typically replaced every 28 days.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either of these could in theory vary, but the effect is normally to put someone onto a cycle that's fairly exactly 28 days long.  If two or more women were to start this on the same day, then they would always synchronize.  If they started it 14 days apart, they would never synchronize, always being 14 days apart.  If either or both women then stopped using hormonal birth control, and reverted to their natural cycle, and if their natural cycle was some length other than exactly 28 days (and not exactly the same as each other), then the cycles would again diverge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastEditorUserId="228" LastEditDate="2015-08-04T13:29:45.950" LastActivityDate="2015-08-04T13:29:45.950" CommentCount="8" />

However, I can definitely say that if you shave your pubes, you will have to make it a habit to shave them quite regularly as even after minor growth, the hair would start pinching you in all the wrong places (Do not even think of shaving the hair around your anus for this very reason). I would like to add that this is particularly true for men from the Indian subcontinent. Men from other parts of the world might have different views/experiences.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Genitals are not a smooth terrain and sometimes it gets tricky to cover all the areas which you want to cover. I do not recommend using any types of razors on or around genitals just because of the possibility of a cut.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion using a good quality trimmer (with a guard) to trim the pubes and then using a hair remover for the final touch lasts a good time. Do use a moisturizer regularly to keep them soft and avoid any chances of itchiness. As far as underarms are concerned, reaching them with a trimmer and applying hair remover can be tricky and hence shaving is the most suitable option. It will just add 4 5 extra minutes to your bath time during the weekends. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Laser hair removal is something that I have never tried and thinking of pulling the hair from their roots sends shivers through my spines.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="211" LastActivityDate="2015-08-03T17:35:12.290" CommentCount="2" />

That said, it is definitely possible for HSV-1 infections to happen at the genitals, and for HSV-2 infections to happen at the mouth.  So it's possible to have &quot;genital herpes&quot; that's HSV-1, or to have &quot;oral herpes&quot; that's HSV-2.  That said, genital HSV-1 is less common than genital HSV-2, and oral HSV-2 is comparatively rare, relative to oral HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to say that it &quot;does... result in transmission&quot; would be putting it too strongly, as transmission of HSV-1 to the genitals is &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; unlikely.

Sperm make up a small percentage (about 2%) of the overall volume of the ejaculate, and the taste is likely elsewhere, e.g. in the fructose and vitamin C - both of which can be found in pineapples, apples, and various other fruits.  This is speculation on my part, but perhaps recent consumption of such sources allows the seminal vesicles, the prostate, and/or the bulbourethral glands to add more of these substances to the semen, thus altering the taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastActivityDate="2015-08-03T18:00:03.460" CommentCount="1" />

The problem is that the anti-circumcision (or &quot;intactivist&quot;) lobby has turned into a radicalized extremist movement that has specialized in producing propaganda and falsified research studies, so the noise:signal ratio is getting extremely high.  So it will be very hard or impossible to get unbiased answers to your question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental difficulty in answering your question is that it depends on subjective answers to survey data.  There is no objective way to measure sexual satisfaction, so we simply have to ask people. Normally that's a relatively minor problem unless you are comparing answers across cultures. However, when one side of an issue is passionate and politicized, you are unlikely to get objective responses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a woman believes strongly that circumcision is genital mutilation, that it is cruel and unnatural, how likely is it that she will report equal satisfaction with circumcised and uncircumcised lovers?  In the first place her satisfaction will be influenced by her feelings about circumcision, and her answers will be further biased by her desire to promote the anti-circumcision cause. In addition, it is a safe bet that she will be far more willing to fill out a questionnaire or answer an online survey than someone with no strong feelings on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second problem with research on both male and female satisfaction with circumcision is the geographic and cultural bias inherent in selecting a survey population.  For example, in many European countries few men are circumcised.  Those that are are typically Muslims, Jews, or men with medical problems that required circumcision. This means that a study that does a naive statistical comparison of, e.g., &quot;circumcised and uncircumcised Belgian men,&quot; is ignoring huge confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is simply no way to avoid substantial bias of some kind in a world in which circumcision is strongly associated with certain cultures, nationalities, and religions and not others. If a woman says she prefers circumcised to uncircumcised men, and it turns out that the only uncircumcised men she's had sex with are Danes and the only circumcised men she's had sex with are Israeli, it is impossible to determine how much of her preference is based on a piece of skin and how much it is based on national and cultural preference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has accumulated substantial evidence that circumcision reduces the transmission of HIV and other STDs.  A few years ago, as evidence on the STD question accumulated, the American Association of Pediatricians moved from a neutral stance to a mildly pro-circumcision stance.  This slight shift was vehemently attacked by the intactivists in the media using an arsenal of deceptive arguments and false claims.  If you're interested, there's an account of the events and a rundown of the attacks at: the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/new-aap-policy-on-circumcision/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; website.  The AAP policy statement, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/e756.abstract&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the technical appendix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/4/801.full&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the rebuttal of the intactivist attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are also worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm no expert and I haven't got time to wade through the claims and counterclaims.  Pediatricians may not have a direct stake in encouraging circumcisions, but obstetricians do, and it wouldn't surprise me if pediatricians tended to support their colleagues, so I'm not going to automatically accept the AAP's verdict. On the other hand, most pediatricians are strongly aligned emotionally as well as professionally toward protecting the welfare of children, so I am not going to automatically dismiss what they say, either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know enough science to recognize specious and dishonest statistics and arguments, and to be offended by them, and that's what I'm seeing from the intactivists.  So for now, it's my policy to assume that anti-circumcision &quot;studies&quot; are bogus unless they have ironclad scientific credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just as one example, another answer to this question cites a Danish study. The lead author of that study, Morten Frisch, is also the leading intactivist who wrote the attack on the AAP policy.  A followup analysis in the same journal cites serious discrepancies in the data and the methods used in that paper.  This is a typical pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One reason I am so skeptical of the intactivist propaganda is that they routinely claim that large percentages of all circumcised men have a variety of serious sexual dysfunctions.  Yet in my own in-depth survey of 60 men who are in long-term heterosexual relationships, the vast majority were circumcised and none had any of these supposedly &quot;common&quot; disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I first became aware of the movement behind this BS as a result of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/circumcision-social-sexual-psychological-realities&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;an article in Popular Psychology&lt;/a&gt; that made claims like this one:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In a landmark study of US women, 85% who had experienced both&#xA;  circumcised and intact men preferred sex with intact men.   Sex with a&#xA;  circumcised man was associated with pain, dryness and difficulty&#xA;  reaching orgasm (O'Hara 1999).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And further down:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The function of the foreskin for women in intercourse is to seal the&#xA;  natural lubrication inside the vagina and provide a gentle internal&#xA;  massaging action. The intact penis moves in and out of its foreskin,&#xA;  which provides a frictionless, rolling, gliding sensation. Intact men&#xA;  tend to make shorter strokes that keep their bodies in contact with&#xA;  the clitoris more, thus aiding female orgasm (O’Hara 1999). On the&#xA;  other hand, the circumcised penis functions like a piston during&#xA;  intercourse – the head of the penis actually scrapes the lubrication&#xA;  out of the vagina with each stroke. As the man thrusts, his skin rubs&#xA;  against the vaginal entrance, causing discomfort, and sometimes pain&#xA;  (O’Hara 1999, Bensley 2001). Far from making sex better for women,&#xA;  circumcision decreases female satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I tracked down this &quot;landmark study&quot; and it consists of preliminary findings from a survey that consists of heavily loaded leading questions.  The respondents were all recruited through ads and notices placed in radical leftist magazines, including the newsletter of an anti-circumcision organization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been 15 years since it was published, with no &quot;final&quot; paper.  So why rely on a very sketchy preliminary report?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the answer becomes clear when you actually read it:  the second part of the quote above isn't even based on anything in the survey questions.  It is purely the opinion of the authors, unsupported by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; research, even the phony kind.  The authors are speculating about why the women in the survey have a preference for &quot;intact&quot; men, trying to imagine some physical mechanism to explain it, even though the obvious explanation is that they solicited participation in a way that would get mostly anti-circumcision respondents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This &quot;landmark study&quot; is about as far from real, honest science as it is possible to get.  Ditto for the article in Psychology Today.  These people started with the goal of &quot;proving&quot; that something they don't like is bad and, to no one's surprise, they succeeded.  That's not science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have no dog in this fight.  I don't have a penis and I don't have a son.

Since you mentioned the legalization of gay marriage in the United States, I concentrated my research there.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An article from the Huffington Post highlights the results from a survey conveyed in 2014 as follows :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;According to the results, 96.6 percent of respondents identified as&#xA;  straight, 1.6 percent identified as gay or lesbian and 0.7 percent&#xA;  identified as bisexual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The reported number of less than 2 percent is lower than some figures&#xA;  released in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So there seems to be a certain stability in numbers, but with the lack of past statistics on the subject, it is hard to come up with a clear answer. On a side note, the personal character of one's definition  of sexual orientation, makes it hard to gather reliable statistics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now here is my take on the three arguments that you proposed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual orientation is hard to define and questioning one's own sexuality  is part of the normal development of each individual. It is not to be compared to a fad or a trend, people have been bullied, suppressed and so on because of their sexual orientation. The legalization of gay marriage in the United States is a step towards acceptance, and people might be more open to trying to understand their own sexuality if they know they are accepted as they are. It won't promote the LGBT community, and won't make people want to &quot;change&quot; their sexual orientation but might encourage those who live in fear or shame to be proud and open as they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the term &quot;contagious&quot; is incorrect here. I would believe that in parts of the world where more people are open about discovering one's sexuality is encouraged, it might be more frequent for men and women to have experiences with people of the same sex. Does that make them gay/lesbian? Not really, as sexuality is not always black or white. Sexuality is also free to change over time.

In the developing world, HSV-1 is almost&#xA;  universal, and usually acquired from intimate contact with family in&#xA;  early childhood (Whitley et al., 1998).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists think HSV-1 may now be the cause of half or almost half of all genital herpes infections in the U.S.:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Until recently, scientists assumed that HSV-1 infections were not&#xA;  sexually transmitted. Now, scientists know that either type can be&#xA;  found in either the oral or genital area, as well as at other sites.&#xA;  In fact, &lt;strong&gt;researchers estimate that HSV-1 is responsible for up to half&#xA;  of all new cases of genital herpes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To infect people, HSV-1 and HSV-2 must get into the body through&#xA;  broken skin or a mucous membrane, such as inside the mouth or in the&#xA;  genital area. In addition to the fluid from fever blisters, each virus&#xA;  can be carried in bodily fluids like saliva, semen, and fluid in the&#xA;  female genital tract.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Both herpes viruses may cause genital infections, and both can be&#xA;  contagious even if the infected person does not have active symptoms&#xA;  or visible blisters.

Many sex toys come with cleaning instructions on the package, and obviously, it makes sense to follow such instructions if you still have the package.  If you don't have instructions, here are some basic guidelines, adapted from an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/sexual_health/sexuality/sex_toys.php#1&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; from Brown University's Health Center:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Start by removing any batteries.  Wet batteries are unhappy batteries. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Nonporous Materials (glass, metal, hard plastic, silicone):&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glass: Warm soapy water.  If the toy is Pyrex, you can just toss it in the dishwasher.  Non-Pyrex glass should not be exposed to high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stainless Steel: If a stainless steel toy is electrical, either unplug it or remove the batteries, then wash with warm soapy water. If the stainless steel toy is not electrical, you can either soak in in a mixture of water and bleach (10% to 20% bleach, the rest water) for 10 to 20 minutes, boil it, or just toss it in the dishwasher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hard Plastic:  Wash with warm soapy water.  You can use antibacterial soap if you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silicone:  Either boil it for 10 minutes, wash it in warm soapy water (antibacterial soap works well), or toss it in the dishwasher.  If the toy is a vibrator, don't boil it, or it will never vibrate again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Porous materials (rubber, vinyl, cyberskin, nylon, and leather)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubber materials: There are all kinds of problems with rubber toys. For starters, rubber is ridiculously porous, which makes it very hard to clean thoroughly.  For another thing, we are starting to learn about all sorts of harmful chemicals that can be leeched out of rubber.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether a particular rubber toy contains such chemicals.  As a result of all of these issues, the best course of action is to always use condoms on your rubber toys.  This removes the need to wash the toy thoroughly.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyberskin/Vinyl: Again, these materials are difficult to clean properly because they are so porous. Use warm water, &lt;strong&gt;no soap&lt;/strong&gt;.  Leave them out to dry.  If they become sticky, which is likely to happen, you can apply a dusting of corn starch or powdered sex toy lubricant (but corn starch is waaaaaay cheaper).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nylon: Throw it in the washing machine, or hand wash with warm soapy water (antibacterial soap is a good idea).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leather: Hard to clean without causing damage.  You can use warm soapy water, or you can use leather cleaner.  If you want/need to, you can apply leather conditioner afterwards.  If there are metal parts, coat them with clear nail polish before cleaning the toy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2015-08-04T08:02:07.860" LastActivityDate="2015-08-04T08:02:07.860" CommentCount="0" />

For example, a foot fetishist may not always need feet to be present or directly involved while having sex, but will not be able to get off without fantasizing about feet. In the same vein, “furries,” or people who dress in animal costumes, may only have to imagine being in costume to get the kind of experience they’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kinks&lt;/strong&gt;:  Kinks on the other hand, are enjoyable activities that do not have to be practiced for sexual gratification (however, if you always indulge your partner’s kink, they will probably be eternally grateful). They can involve objects or objectification, but certainly don’t have to, and don’t have to be the main focus of a sexual encounter. For example, all of you who are getting down in the showers can now identify as kinky, and judging from what Conn students write in certain anonymous forums, there are some kinky people on campus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mensjournal.com/expert-advice/sexual-fetishes-what-you-need-to-know-20150401/the-difference-between-a-fetish-and-kink#ixzz3hp6Hzqjo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Source #3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kink&lt;/strong&gt;: People who are in the kink community like to discriminate fetish from kink by saying that kink is more focused on the person but the activity is part of the fun,&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetish&lt;/strong&gt;:  On the other hand, people who have a fetish are intensely focused on a specific object or ritual as part of their sexuality. They need whatever that is to experience any kind of sexual arousal or turn-on, making their sexuality more dependent on their fetish than on their partner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Lessons Learned:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It appears that these descriptions have at least a couple of things in common, in terms of their description of what separates kinks from fetishes:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fetishes are more focused on objects, as opposed to people.  Kinks can involve objects, but the person is more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fetishes are more consuming:  If you can't get off without X, it is likely that X is a fetish, not a kink.  However, this doesn't mean that people who have fetishes are incapable of getting off in any other way, only that this is more likely to be the case for fetishists than kinky people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do kinks and fetishes have in common?  Both are usually related to sexual behaviors which many people would consider unusual or abnormal.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example:  I am a hetero male.  I love boobs.  I love big boobs.  I love small boobs.  I love in between boobs.  None of these things are fetishes, and none of these things are kinks.

I've talked to college roommates who insisted they were &quot;&lt;em&gt;synched by Thanksgiving&lt;/em&gt;&quot; even though one had a reliable 27-day period and the other had one that was always 31-33 days.  While it's true that their menstrual days will come closer and closer together for several months, it's also true that they will then slide further apart, since one of them is going to have roughly six periods for every five that the other one has.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You also find women who will insist that synchronization occurs even when some or all of them are on hormonal birth control, in spite of the fact that the artificially-supplied hormones disrupt the normal chemistry of ovulation.

As you note, Kinsey described numerous cases of young girls using their hands or humping furniture or cushions and appearing to orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for boys prior to semenarche, this is from a private communication:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Many boys continue to masturbate after orgasm, and since they do not&#xA;  ejaculate they maintain their erection.

They handle&#xA;  their own feet, head, genitalia, umbilical cord, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We recently observed a female fetus at 32 weeks' gestation touching&#xA;  the vulva with fingers of [her] right hand. The caressing movement was&#xA;  centered primarily on the region of the clitoris. Movements stopped&#xA;  after 30 to 40 seconds, and started again after a few moments.&#xA;  Further, these light touches were repeated and were associated with&#xA;  short, rigid movements of the pelvis and legs. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;After another break, in addition to this behavior, the fetus&#xA;  contracted the muscles of the trunk and limbs, and the climax,&#xA;  clonicotonic movements [rapid muscle contractions] of the body,&#xA;  followed. Finally she relaxed and rested.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We observed this behavior for about 20 minutes. The mother was an&#xA;  active and interested witness, conversing with observers about her&#xA;  child's experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Evidence of male fetuses' excitement reflex in utero, such as erection&#xA;  or ″masturbation” movements, has been previously reported. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The current observation seems to show not only that the excitement&#xA;  reflex can be evoked in female fetuses at the third trimester of&#xA;  gestation but also that the orgasmic reflex can be elicited during&#xA;  intrauterine life. This would agree with the physiologic features of&#xA;  female sexuality: &lt;em&gt;The female sexual response is separate from&#xA;  reproductive functions and doesn't need a full sexual maturity to be&#xA;  explicit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No one is going to allow adults to do serious research on kids having orgasms, so your last question - Is the physiology of a prepubescent orgasm the same as that of an adult orgasm? - probably can't be answered scientifically.  However, all the people I've talked to about this agree that the physiology &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to be the same, and as Giorgi and Siccardi say, it appears to be fully mature by the third trimester of pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="228" LastEditorUserId="228" LastEditDate="2015-08-14T02:11:56.800" LastActivityDate="2015-08-14T02:11:56.800" CommentCount="2" />

He died in 1995. In the last two decades of his life he was respectfully called the “Sex-Papst” = “pope of sex” in TV and print-magazines, because when ever any sex-related topic was discussed in public, he was asked in talkshows and interviews.)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During his researches (mainly interviews with adults who talked about their childhood, but also findings from journeys to other cultures), Bornemann came to the result, that when ever a child has found out how to masturbate, it does it again and again, because they experience it as something lustful. And during this interviews he also found out, that many adults remember to have had spasms combined with an intense feeling of arousal, which can be interpreted as an orgasm. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this is exactly what I have in memory from my own childhood. I remember, that those moments was rare, and way less intense then the orgasms that I had when I was able to ejaculate, but there definitely was some kind of mini-climax.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the “hardware” of a child's body is fully equipped with everything that is necessary to react on sexual stimulation, I find it not very surprising that also children can have orgasms, even if they might be less intense. But as far as I know, there is very little research on this topic nowadays. So I'm not sure, if there are any serious resources, which can tell you, if all children can have orgasms, or if some of them only become able to it when they reach the age of puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me add some words on Ernest Bornemann:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bornemann did not interview only people from Europe. He also made journeys to foreign countries where he met cultures, that many of us tend to call “primitive”. Most of those cultures have thoughts of morality, that are very different from western world's morality. So Bornemann also met cultures, where sexual interaction with minors is not a tabu, and Bornemann learned a lot about prepubescent sexuality from those cultures. But when in the early 1990ies publications of Bornemann form the 1970ies became public, he was strongly attacked and he quickly lost his glorious state of a “pope of sex” and from those days on he was shunned by magazines and TV-stations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In those publications Bornemann said, that sexual interaction among children and between children and adults can help to lower the level of aggression of children, and would lead to mentally healthier kids. In 1977 in an Austrian Newspaper (“Arbeiterzeitung”) he also advocated rooms in schools, where children could experience their sexuality without repression. This of course found no majority, but in 1977 this was not a big deal and soon was forgotten. But 15 or 20 years later, when it was announced again, it marked the end of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="115" LastActivityDate="2015-08-04T09:04:52.273" CommentCount="0" />

Only about 15% of the lesbians had sex more than twice a week, compared to 50% or more of the others, and about 40% said there were weeks when they had no sex at all, compared to less than 20% of the rest of the sample. But if you looked at how long each sexual encounter lasted, women in same-sex relationships were champs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it seems like there is some evidence behind this. BUT, here is what follows the first statements of the study: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Gay men and especially male and female heterosexuals reported typical sexual encounters of a half hour or less, often much less. Lesbians, on the other hand, described sexual sessions lasting upward of 30 minutes, and nearly 10% reported encounters of two hours or more. This is our first hint that the measure of “sexual frequency” is inadequate. Perhaps lesbians have lower frequency because if each sexual encounter involves extended periods of sensual and sexual activity, it is harder to find time for sex. And if sex is that intense, maybe you don’t need or desire it as frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is, indeed, an important detail to underline: duration, quality and intensity over frequency. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, sexuality is subjective and different for everyone.

And being resorbed means, that (at least as first step) it becomes part of your blood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your veins, all the molecules, that passed this barrier circulate through your body. Fat, sugar, proteins, water, alcohol, maybe some medication, this all is in your blood. But also lots of other molecules circulate through your veins after a meal, until they are converted into other molecules in your liver (the first station blood from your stomach has to pass), or excreted by your kidneys as part of urine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Pineapples contain two molecule that are responsible for it's characteristic taste and smell. They are named “ethyl butyrate” and “butyl butyrate”. Both belong to a group of substances, that are called “fruit esters” because chemically they are esters, and because all of them intensively smell like ripe fruits. (Some of them smell like apple, strawberry, oranges, apricots or other fruits, and a mixture of ethyl butyrate and butyl butyrate just smells like pineapples).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those molecules are rather small (compared to other organic molecules), so they easily can pass from your stomach and bowel into your blood, and later into the liquid from what semen is produced. This can go much faster than it's dismantling in the liver or excretion by your kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this is the way how the taste of your food comes into your semen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;There is a German magazine with the name “Men's Health” (yes, it has an english title, but it is all in German: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menshealth.de&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.menshealth.de&lt;/a&gt; ). And about 15 or 20 years ago they asked some couples to test how food influences the taste of semen. As far as I remember it was about 10 couples who noted for a period of many weeks, what the male parters ate, and how their sperm tasted afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They reported, that coffee, onions and garlic produced the worst taste. When the men ate no meat for a longer period of time, the semen tasted better. The best taste was produced when they drank fruit-juices, and among those juices pineapple-juice was the winner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is of course not a scientific research, because it did not meet all conditions that are necessary for a scientific research, but I think it is good enough to refer to when talking about the taste of sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="115" LastActivityDate="2015-08-04T16:42:42.930" CommentCount="3" />

Unless you kill the hair follicles, the method of removal won't affect the growth rate at all, in spite of many myths to the contrary.  So the time for hair to regrow to a certain length depends entirely on how much of each hair you remove.  Razors lop it off at skin level.  Tweezers, waxing, sugaring, etc. pull it out by the roots so it takes longer to grow back above the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any razor you can use on your face should work for everything else except your penis and scrotum.  For those two areas, I recommend a multi-bladed manual razor.&#xA;My partner uses one that has five blades in each replaceable cartridge and it takes him only a minute or two per week to swipe the hairs from the shaft and around the base of the penis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also recommend using scissors every week or two to trim the pubic hair above the penis to an inch or so if yours grows much longer than that.  Some men prefer to shave it completely, and some women prefer it that way.  (If in doubt, ask!) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One interesting tidbit:  trimming or shaving the long pubes down there can make a man's penis appear larger from his own perspective, contributing to a subtle confidence boost!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what about the balls?  Most men have a lot of long hairs growing from the scrotum.  If you don't care about getting oral in that area, that's fine.  But if you do, you need to learn how to shave your scrotum and then keep it hair-free.  This takes longer, perhaps 10 minutes a week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of men are scared to take a razor down there.  Don't be.  Modern multi-bladed razors work fine as long as you stretch the skin smooth and use a light touch. Don't scrape hard the way you shave your face!  The skin on the scrotum is much thinner and more delicate, and you don't want to shave the tops off the little sebum glands the hairs grow out of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When my SO shaves his shaft and scrotum, he does it dry with a very light touch.  He prefers shaving dry in that area because wet skin is softer and easier to cut and shaving cream just interferes with his vision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, do NOT try using an electric razor on your penis or scrotum.

This hurts and leaves the area red and angry for a while, but it lasts longer before you can feel a stubble.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Electrolysis or laser treatment can remove hair permanently, but both are expensive and it takes multiple sessions over ~6 months to get almost all of the hair.  Lasers work best with darker hair and fair skin, so that option may not work for you if you have dark skin or very light hair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="228" LastActivityDate="2015-08-04T18:33:25.873" CommentCount="0" />

If you've ever tried it, you know it's not easy. (There's a trick to it; see below.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, it's hard to do this without getting air trapped at the end of the condom, which leads to breakage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, even if you succeed, as simon's.donut noted, the condom probably won't be positioned properly. As the penis straightens and elongates, it will push the condom differentially, creating twists and stress points and tending to pull the base of the condom forward on the shaft.  This reduces the amount of the shaft protected against infection and increases the chance that the condom will come off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it's important to have an empty space at the end of the condom to provide room for the semen.  This is why you are supposed to pinch the end of a condom before rolling it onto an erection.  But if you put the condom on a flaccid penis, the erection process will usually push the head of the penis forward until it fills that space, leading once again to increased risk of breakage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO DO IT RIGHT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all these reasons &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to put a condom on a soft penis, it's still sometimes necessary to do it.  Typically this happens when a man has erection problems and his partner is trying to use oral sex to get him hard while still avoiding the risk of STDs.  So:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pinch and fold over an extra large semen pocket at the tip of the condom. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unroll the condom another inch, just enough for the head of the&#xA;penis.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Push the head of the soft penis into that space, making sure you&#xA;don't trap any air inside.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have the man grip the head of the penis &lt;em&gt;very tightly&lt;/em&gt; through the condom&#xA;and pull hard away from his body, being careful not to pull the condom off&#xA;or let the tip of the condom unfold.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Roll the rest of the condom down the shaft, being careful to keep it&#xA;straight and not to allow any air to get inside.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grip the ring at the base of the condom in one fist and keep that&#xA;hand firmly in place until a full erection has been achieved.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As the penis swells, check to be sure that there is still some slack&#xA;at the tip; you may need to tug it upward a bit to be sure there is&#xA;room for the ejaculate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so it's doable, but as you can see it's &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; easier to do it right if the penis is hard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="228" LastEditorUserId="228" LastEditDate="2015-08-11T22:28:49.157" LastActivityDate="2015-08-11T22:28:49.157" CommentCount="0" />

There was research done in the 30s and 40s on condom failures, and reuse was one of the main culprits identified at the time.  Particularly during the depression, the cost of condoms was non-trivial, especially for the poor, and reuse was common, so the &quot;don't reuse&quot; meme became embedded in the condom use literature.  And, of course, condom makers were delighted to give it prominence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, those studies all seem to be on dead trees, not available on the internet, so we can't judge how careful they were.  But as recently as 2005, &lt;strong&gt;Prevalence of condom use errors among STD clinic patients,&lt;/strong&gt; by Diane Grimley et al., cited reuse as one of the factors leading to STDs.  Since Dr. Grimley retired there no longer seems to be a copy of that paper that isn't paywalled, but here's a short summary:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://chealth.canoe.com/channel_section_details.asp?text_id=3741&amp;amp;channel_id=16&amp;amp;relation_id=30110&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Study: Condoms often misused, increasing STI risk&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Among the study participants, more than 15% tested positive for&#xA;  gonorrhea, chlamydia, or both of these STIs. Moreover, almost a&#xA;  quarter of the participants indicated they had made errors in using a&#xA;  condom during the last month.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Common mistakes included putting on the condom inside out and then&#xA;  flipping it over to have sex, not leaving a space at the tip of the&#xA;  condom, not holding the base during withdrawal, &lt;strong&gt;reusing a condom&lt;/strong&gt;, and&#xA;  starting to have sex and then putting on the condom during&#xA;  intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there are two big problems with the research on condom misuse:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, all the research is based on self-reports, and other research has shown convincingly that people frequently blame condom failures because they don't like admitting that they had sex without a condom.  For example, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2722689/#R30&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Condom Failure: Examining the Objective and Cultural Meanings Expressed in Interviews With African American Adolescents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Snitzman et al. provides a fascinating analysis of the prevalence of &quot;blaming the condom&quot; in one subculture.  And this obviously messes up the data and screws with the research results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, no one seems to make a distinction between different kinds of reuse.  The kind the question refers to - leaving it in place for 5-10 minutes and then resuming intercourse - may be more or less risky than a completely different kind of reuse - taking it off, rinsing it out, letting it dry, rerolling it, and using it again a few days later, a pattern that is common in some poor areas. There's some reason to think that the second process works reasonably well against pregnancy, but not against disease.  However, lumping such different things together makes it hard to decide on the risks involved with either one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we're left to hypothesize.  Clearly when the penis shrinks, the condom becomes loose, and there is opportunity for semen to ooze into the gaps, perhaps contaminating the base of the shaft.  It's natural to pull the base of the condom firmly back as close to the base of the soft penis as possible to keep it in place and prevent leakage, but this could actually promote getting semen on parts of the shaft that will be exposed when the second erection develops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also possible for bacteria and viruses on the previously exposed base of the penis to mix with semen in this scenario and then get in contact with the head of the penis when the condom is later removed, although this seems a lot less likely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; risk in this scenario is very low, and that - in spite of what your teacher said - retaining the condom in place during the interval is much, much safer for both parties than &quot;&lt;em&gt;if you never had one to begin with.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;  If only one condom were available in this situation, I would definitely make the guy use it and keep it on for the second round.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if I were teaching sex ed to teenagers, that would be too complicated and would lead to all sorts of confusion, so I too would repeat the simple rule about never reusing a condom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reminder:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's always a good idea to wash your penis after withdrawing it from a condom in the middle of an ongoing encounter.  Otherwise you can get sperm, bacteria, and viruses on your fingers and then transfer them to your partner's body.  (If this isn't practical, it might actually be safer to leave one condom in place than to change condoms during a short refractory period.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also be careful about handling any used condom, since your fingers can carry fluids from the outside of the condom to your mouth or penis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="228" LastEditorUserId="228" LastEditDate="2015-08-05T21:01:05.660" LastActivityDate="2015-08-05T21:01:05.660" CommentCount="0" />

After semenarche, it can happen naturally and some men can do it deliberately.

Often they are unclear about whether a dry orgasm should count as a &quot;real&quot; orgasm, but the descriptions they give are essentially identical to the ones girls and women use to describe their own orgasms.

They found “that detumescence&#xA;  does not always follow an orgasm, &lt;strong&gt;that a nonejaculatory orgasm can&#xA;  occur prior to as well as after an ejaculatory orgasm,&lt;/strong&gt; and that it is&#xA;  possible to have a series of orgasms. Some of the men reported always&#xA;  having been multiply orgasmic, whereas others experienced it&#xA;  relatively late in life. Others have actively learned to become&#xA;  multiply orgasmic.” Of these, eight were men who learned to become&#xA;  multi-orgasmic after age 35. (&quot;Male multiple orgasms: a descriptive&#xA;  study.&quot; Dunn, Marion E; Trost, Jan E, Arch Sex Behav. 1989&#xA;  Oct;18(5):377-87.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dunn and Trost actually lump two different kinds of dry orgasms together.  One is natural and typically occurs immediately before or after a normal ejaculatory orgasm, especially if the man has been highly aroused for an unusually long period of time. &quot;Preshocks&quot; are dry orgasms leading up to the primary ejaculatory orgasm, usually with a separation of 5-15 seconds. &quot;Aftershocks&quot; occur most often as a result of strong manual stimulation during and after an ejaculatory orgasm, but some men routinely have a series of orgasms even during regular vaginal sex. They may or may not be completely dry. What all of these orgasm have in common is that they are spontaneous. You can create the conditions for them, but you can't compel them to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intentional &quot;Drygasms&quot; in Adult Males&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second type of dry orgasm referred to by Dunn and Trost is one that is consciously controlled by the man. As a general rule, this type of orgasm is followed by a partial drop in the level of arousal but no loss of erection.  If stimulation continues at a high level the man will typically be able to have another orgasm in 1 to 5 minutes, although of course it can take longer at lower levels of stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Hartman &amp;amp; Fithian were among the most respected sex researchers of&#xA;  their era.

(Orgasms&#xA;  were defined and determined by recording and measuring the rapid&#xA;  increases in the heart rate and the involuntary contractions of the&#xA;  anal sphincter and pelvic muscles.) These 33 men averaged four orgasms&#xA;  per session, which was typically 20-30 minutes, with the record held&#xA;  by a young man who had 16 consecutive orgasms in less than an hour, an&#xA;  average of less than 4 minutes for each one! The subjects also&#xA;  included one man who could have multiple ejaculations in a row without&#xA;  loss of erection. [Ibid.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 32 out of 33 cases, these men were having dry orgasms before (optionally) a final orgasm with ejaculation. Interestingly, H&amp;amp;F were unable to tell reliably from the EKG recordings whether an orgasm was accompanied by ejaculation.  Both dry and normal orgasms had the same pattern of heart rate acceleration just before and during the orgasm and the same deceleration afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Observations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My long-term partner regularly experiences both kinds of dry orgasm.

During his massage, I'm in an excellent position to observe his arousal levels and his orgasms at close range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Except for the lack of ejaculate, a controlled drygasm seems indistinguishable to me from a normal orgasm. Preshocks and aftershocks likewise appear normal, except that the penis does begin to go soft during a long series of aftershocks.

What it does say at widely separated points is that (a) Trobrianders play ribald games at gatherings during the full moon; (b) islanders who work for whites sometimes mimic the inept (in their estimation) copulatory flailings of their employers; and (c) &lt;strong&gt;some Trobrianders object to public displays of affection between lovers, which they term &lt;em&gt;misinari si bubunela&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;missionary fashion,&quot; viewing such things as an immoral Christian import&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Kinsey in his book claims that the Christian church once considered non-MP sex sinful. &lt;strong&gt;Priest conjectures that Kinsey conflated these disparate elements to come up with the missionary position tale, apparently never bothering to compare his faulty recollection against Malinowski's words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2015-08-06T16:03:21.867" LastActivityDate="2015-08-06T16:03:21.867" CommentCount="3" />

This may hint that most or many pornographic videos are without condoms, which support that there is no preventative care in the amateur pornography business.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The underlying reason for the avoidance of using condoms, in Bangladesh, may be connected with &quot;social dimensions of masculine sexuality, pleasure, eroticism and the emotional aspect of men’s lives.&quot; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In addition,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual prowess in the form of prolonged intercourse without condoms,&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  &lt;strong&gt;as depicted in Western pornography&lt;/strong&gt;, was perceived as a ‘real man’s’&#xA;  sexual skill. Men sought to preserve a ‘good man’s’ image by avoiding&#xA;  condoms, which symbolised promiscuous men in AIDS educational&#xA;  messages. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Western pornography is laden with images of condom-less sex. Sexual intercourse without condoms is a form of sexual prowess of a &quot;real man&quot; or a &quot;good man,&quot; presumably free of AIDS and other venereal diseases.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&quot;Healthcare&quot; in Hot Girls Wanted (2015) documentary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Hot Girls Wanted (2015) documentary, a group of young adult girls is recruited to Florida to work in the amateur porn industry. Why Florida? Because Florida does not ban pornography made without condoms. One of the girls develops a cyst for producing too much natural lubricant due to having too much sex in a day, and she becomes hospitalized. When she recovers, she has to pay her own medical bill with her own money, presumably paid for by her income. It seems that the amateur porn industry does not have a retirement plan or a medical coverage plan for its workers. That same girl also reveals her occupation as a porn actress to her mother, and her mother immediately expresses concern for her, asking the daughter whether she uses contraceptives. &lt;em&gt;The girl reports that she does not, but she does use regular medical check-ups. It is through this documentary that I've become aware that not only are there no condoms in many pornographies, but also the porn stars have to pay for their medical bills.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;References:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silvera, Richard, et al. &quot;Condom use and male homosexual pornography.&quot; &lt;em&gt;American journal of public health&lt;/em&gt; 99.10 (2009): 1732.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan, Sharful Islam, et al. &quot;Safer sex or pleasurable sex?

A more relative answer is needed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A fetish is dysfunctional if it leads to dysfunction in the fetish holder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a person's fetish leads to harm for themselves or others, we could reasonably say that it is dysfunctional.  However, if the person continues to be a happy, healthy, non-disruptive member of society, their fetish is not dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastActivityDate="2015-08-07T20:31:16.220" CommentCount="0" />

When I started writing this answer, it had been my understanding that impotence referred to an inability for a man to get his female partner pregnant, due to any number of conditions.

In fact, apparently &quot;impotence&quot; derives from the Latin phrase &lt;em&gt;impotentia coeundi&lt;/em&gt;, which refers specifically from an inability to insert the penis into the vagina.  So, that sounds pretty specifically like ED.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it would seem that, in a sexual context, impotence and erectile dysfunction refer to the same phenomenon.

Unfortunately, I can't find the article I'm thinking of, so I'll paraphrase for now and update this later if I find it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, many mammals and birds routinely watch others mate.  For a lot of them, it's essential sex ed, and they will have trouble mating successfully as adults if they never see others of their species do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; animals also pay close attention to who mates with whom, because that is an important type of information about the status competition within the group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But voyeurism implies more than curiosity.  It implies (A) getting turned on by the mating activities of others, and (B) perhaps seeking it out as a pleasure in its own right.  And it turns out that (A) sometimes happens, but (B) seems to be solely a human thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sea lions are one of the species that seem to get aroused when others near them are having sex.  If I remember correctly, young males in some &quot;tournament&quot; species are more likely to challenge the Alpha male after seeing him mount a female, but I'm not sure that counts as sexual arousal or just opportunism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Among animals, particularly social animals, curiosity is common, but arousal is rare.

It seems to be one of those false but plausible-sounding factoids that floats around the internet and just won't die. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there does seem to be a broad consensus among sexologists, sex therapists, and sex educators that the answer is &quot;No.&quot;  There are no known cases where a woman who could previously have orgasms without a vibrator has lost that ability because of reliance on a vibrator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most respected experts in the younger generation in this field is Dr. Emily Nagoski, and she put it like this in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1476762090&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Come as You Are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (p.288):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The concern people most often bring to me about vibrators is that&#xA;  they'll get &quot;addicted&quot; to them, but it doesn't happen.  Here's what&#xA;  does happen: Orgasm with vibrators occurs relatively quickly for many&#xA;  women because a vibrator provides a high intensity of stimulation. &#xA;  And some women get very comfortable with how quickly they orgasm with&#xA;  their vibrator, which leads them to forget how long it took without&#xA;  the vibrator. And when they get frustrated by how long that takes, the&#xA;  frustration makes it take even longer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I strongly recommend that book, by the way.  I've read a lot the books in this field, and this is the best single volume on women's sexuality that I've found.  Whether you're a woman or you're someone who loves women, it's a great read.  It's often funny, but it's always solidly grounded in real science, not hokum.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my own discussions with women, this is a minor factor or a non-issue for most.  It seems to happen mainly for women who are hard-driving, impatient, and constantly in a hurry.  It's not that they have become &quot;dependent&quot; on vibrators for arousal, but rather that they are impatient with their own bodies and resent how long it takes to get an orgasm without mechanical help. That impatience and resentment then delays or shuts down the orgasm.  Often they simply need to be reminded to slow down and set aside enough time for slower, more leisurely sex, whether it's solo or with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But for the vast majority of women who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use vibrators, they're a blessing.  One of the oldest rules in sex therapy for women is that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0130727113&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the more orgasms a woman has had, the easier it is [for her] to have more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; For a pre-orgasmic woman with a relatively high threshold who is looking for her first orgasm, it's almost always a vibrator that makes it possible. Once she's had the first, the next is easier, and so on, until finally she can have an orgasm from manual stimulation and/or oral sex, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also many, many women who cannot have an orgasm just from vaginal sex.  Getting to orgasm with a partner may require a longish session of manual and oral sex before transitioning to vaginal sex, but there often isn't time for that.  As a result, men who want to be good lovers and who have partners who fit this profile are increasingly incorporating a vibrator into the preliminaries and using it to help give their partners that first orgasm.  Once she's had that first one with the vibrator, additional orgasms come much more easily without it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, it's been many years since my partner and I even considered having a quickie without a vibrator, because we know I won't get any orgasms at all without either much more time or a power assist.  But by using a vibrator to help me have a quick orgasm or two at the start, my partner can almost always give me &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; one more orgasm during the vaginal sex that follows.  We normally take the time to have sex in a more leisurely way, but like many busy couples, sometimes we have to take what we can get.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To sum it up:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, using a vibrator will not increase a woman's orgasmic threshold or make it physically or neurologically harder for her to have normal orgasms.

So by definition there is nothing like pornography made by animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there is a second point of view. The definition from above is focused on the production of pornography. But there are also consumers of pornography, who did not create the recordings. So is seems to be possible to have pornography that is made by humans to be consumed by animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And there really is something like this. “Behavioural Biology” is a scientific discipline where scientists do research about the behavior of animals. And in this discipline it is a standard procedure, to use dummies to lure animals from some species.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example they use man-made dummies, that look like a male or female fish of a certain species to attract individuals from the other gender. The lured animals then often act as if there was a real fish. (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.at/books?id=L_Hedxcy8O4C&amp;amp;pg=PA304&amp;amp;lpg=PA304&amp;amp;dq=behavioural%20dummy%20-%22for%20dummies%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=vHqvHVtl7h&amp;amp;sig=7SeAmD98yjCb9WrbE3SSM-EjEnM&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIkar8zOeYxwIVyD8UCh1Msgcx#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=behavioural%20dummy%20-%22for%20dummies%22&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Behavioural Ecology of Fishes&lt;/a&gt;) They often show the full spectrum of courtship display.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those dummies don't need really to look exactly like real individuals. You can try it out, if you know a place where toads and frogs are living. Just place a stone of about the size of a frog in shallow water and wait. If you are patient enough, you will find male frogs that will clasp this stone the same way they would clasp a female frog, and they also will ejaculate when mating the stone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To come back to the question:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Animals don't create pornography, but they react on dummies that “exudes that special charm” in the same way as humans react when they see a sex-doll.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Voyeurism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voyeurism means to watch, but not to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The frontal lobe is that part of a human's brain, that is located just behind your forehead, above your eyes. Medical history knows many cases of people who lived without any handicaps after this region of brain was damaged (most famous is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Phineas Gage&lt;/a&gt;). But the victims personality did change dramatically. People who were noble and restrained became unpredictable and instinctive. They lost discipline and self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So scientists believe that the function of the human frontal lobe is to control the impulses and signals that come from the rest of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a man sees a naked woman in the neighbors house, the parts of his brain that are responsible for sexual arousal will be activated and most parts of this man's brain say: “Go to that naked woman and have sex with her. Go now! Go!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the frontal lobe says: “No, this not a good idea. You will get trouble if you do it. It is not wise. Stay here.” And so, this man stays outside of the woman's house. But still the primeval parts of his brain fire impulses saying “look at those boobs and ass! Go NOW!” And in this situation the frontal lobe might say: “Well, it's still not a good idea, but you can stay here and keep watching.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this is what voyeurism is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this is impossible for people with a frontal lobe that is not working properly. A man like Phineas Gage is unable to stay where he is when he sees a naked woman. He must go to her and he must try to have sex with her because this is what the primeval parts of his brain call for. And there is no intelligent controller which stops the man from always doing what he wants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What has this to do with the question? With animal-voyeurism?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, the frontal lobe is that part of a humans body, that most of all distinguishes humans from animals. Some animals (apes, dogs) have rudimentary equivalents of this part of brain, but most animals have nothing that can be compared with it. And a human's frontal lobe is really big (see the picture at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;frontal lobe at Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;). I guess is is a quarter of the whole human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So animals have no “voice” in their brain that stops them from following the primeval drives. When a male hamster sees or smells a female hamster, he is unable to stay hidden behind a bush and just watch her. Either he don't recognize her at all, or he wants to go to her to have sex with her. There is nothing in between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this is true for all animals that don't have a very highly developed frontal lobe, and so it is true for all animals except Homo sapiens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being sexually aroused and attracted by an individual without trying to have intercourse with this individual is--as far as I know--not possible for animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="115" LastEditorUserId="64" LastEditDate="2015-08-08T15:38:04.927" LastActivityDate="2015-08-08T15:38:04.927" CommentCount="0" />

This means that with so many more men doing it, it's more likely that a man will succumb to this addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been known to cause relationship issues from a lack of sexual interest, a general loss of affection, and may even interfere with work and extracurricular activities.

This was accomplished by flushing the Vasalgel from the vas deferens with an injection of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) solution.

The purpose of the study is to test the contraceptive efficacy of RISUG in a large and varied group of men. After being given RISUG, volunteers will be asked to make regular follow up visits.

The first sought to determine whether any or all the types&#xA;  of sex-with-partner orgasms identified in the latent-class analysis&#xA;  differed from solitary-masturbatory orgasms in terms of how they were&#xA;  described; the second set of analyses compared the four orgasms&#xA;  subtypes which emerged from the latent class analysis of data from the&#xA;  sex with partner group on a set of external correlates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, to support the &lt;strong&gt;fourfold typology of orgasms&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Apparently, at least in terms of the orgasm experience itself,&#xA;  sometimes sex with oneself is more physically pleasurable than sex&#xA;  with a male partner, even when the latter provides sufficient sexual&#xA;  arousal to generate an orgasm. Fundamentally, these data would seem to&#xA;  contradict the Masters and Johnson (1965) view that masturbatory&#xA;  orgasms are the same as those achieved through intercourse, especially&#xA;  in terms of pleasure and sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be 4 different types of orgasms.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The female participants are classified into &quot;types&quot;, based on subjective ratings: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type I&lt;/strong&gt;, labelled ‘‘High Pleasure and Sensations,’’ described them as manifesting the most building, flooding, flushing, spurting, and throbbing sensations, as well as involving the most general spasm, relaxation, and emotional intimacy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type II&lt;/strong&gt; orgasms of 159 participants were labelled ‘‘High Pleasure, Medium Sensations’’ and defined by high scores on components relating to pleasure but noticeably lower on scores relating to internal sensations and feelings of relaxation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type III&lt;/strong&gt;, labelled‘‘Medium Pleasure and Sensations,’’defined by relatively low scores in areas relating to internal sensations and in components describing pleasure and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type IV&lt;/strong&gt;,‘‘Low Pleasure and Sensation.’’&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In sum, whereas some orgasms achieved with a partner— Types I and&#xA;  II—proved to be of higher quality than those achieved on one’s own,&#xA;  perhaps meriting the label‘‘good-sex orgasms,’’ other, seemingly&#xA;  ‘‘not-as-good-sex’’ orgasms achieved with a partner—Types III and&#xA;  IV—proved to be of lower quality than those experienced all by&#xA;  oneself.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Thus, Types I and II were combined to create Type A (i.e., good-sex&#xA;  orgasms) and Types III and IV were combined into Type B (i.e.,&#xA;  not-as-good-sex orgasms) for use in the second stage of&#xA;  orgasm-typology validation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Types I and II (good-sex orgasms) may involve subjectively long-lasting orgasms, higher intensity of physical sensations (internal sensations related to the peristalsis of insuck creation), and higher ratings of intensity of non-physical sensations (specific non-physical dreamy, floaty sensations that also accompany oxytocin release). In regards to emotion, Types I and II (good-sex orgasms) may involve (1) greater happiness in and (2) satisfaction with the current relationship, and (3) engender feelings of greater emotional closeness to the sex partner than not-as-good-sex orgasms (Type III and IV). Types I and II (good-sex orgasms), in contrast to expectations perhaps derived from Masters and Johnson’s (1965) conclusion that there is one type of female orgasm brought about by stimulation of the outer genitalia, are not more frequent during intercourse than Type III and IV (not-as-good orgasms). Finally, Types I and II (good-sex orgasms) are proved to be centered on the whole body, whereas Types III and IV are presumably more localized. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a different paper, Jannini, et al., conclude that the assumption that women may experience only the clitoral, external, orgasm is not based on the best available scientific evidence. In other words, some women do experience VAO (Vaginally Activated Orgasm), as opposed to CO (Clitoral Orgasm). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[A] more recent microdissection and immunohistochemical study of the&#xA;  human vagina found that the distal AVW (Anterior Vaginal Wall) is&#xA;  significantly thicker than the proximal AVW  and that this region is&#xA;  the most densely innervated area [10].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This may suggest that some female individuals may have a thicker and more densely innervated distal part of the anterior vaginal wall than other female individuals, which may explain why some women experience orgasms through deep vaginal penetrations and others don't. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jannini, et al., also cite Odile Buisson, a gynecologist from Paris, expert in vaginal echography. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Basically, her position is that the VAO could be caused by contact of&#xA;  the internal clitoris and the AVW. The proximity of the contact could&#xA;  be enhanced by reflex perineal contractions and vasomotor events,&#xA;  which occur in the case of erotic stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jannini, et al., also point out that in 1998, there was the discovery that the clitoris and vagina might both play a role together simultaneously during vaginal intercourse. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;During vaginal penetration, in fact, the root of the clitoris is&#xA;  stretched by the penis and compressed against the AVW and the pubic&#xA;  symphysis [17]. The clitoris and vagina could be seen as an anatomical&#xA;  and functional unit being activated by vaginal penetration during&#xA;  intercourse. For this reason, and with the aim to involve the urethra&#xA;  and the surrounding exocrine glands, Jannini et al. named the area&#xA;  triggering the VAO as clito-urethro-vaginal (CUV) complex [22], a name&#xA;  probably more correctly able to describe the G-spot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jannini, et al., also cites support for different orgasms (clitoral and vaginal) based on Dr. Brody's findings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Stuart Brody, Professor of Psychology at the University of the West of&#xA;  Scotland, UK, maintains that orgasm triggered by stimulation of the&#xA;  vagina and cervix differs physiologically from climax induced by&#xA;  clitoral stimulation. He firstly reported a dramatic difference (400%)&#xA;  in prolactin release (a marker of psychoneuroendocrine involvement)&#xA;  when comparing penile-vaginal intercourse (PVI) to masturbation [24].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Barry R. Komisaruk, Professor at the Department of Psychology, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey and Adjunct Professor at the Department of Radiology of the New Jersey Medical School is cited by Jannini, et al., as supportive of the existence of a different orgasmic pathway other than the clitoral pathway. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;he found that women with a completely severed spinal cord can have&#xA;  both VAO and cervical orgasms, verifiable by functional magnetic&#xA;  resonance imaging (fMRI), even in the absence of any clitoral&#xA;  connection to the brain [25,26]. This seems a convincing argument in&#xA;  favor of more than one unique orgasmic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are different types of female orgasms. From the King, et al., study, there are four different types of orgasms. Two of them (Types I and II) are classified as &quot;good-sex orgasms&quot;, and two of them are classified as &quot;not-as-good sex orgasms&quot; (Types III and IV). From the Jannini, et al., study, there seems to be a distinct difference between clitoral orgasm (CO) and vaginal activated orgasm or vaginal orgasm (VAO or VO).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;References:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jannini, Emmanuele A, et al. &quot;Female Orgasm(S): One, Two, Several.&quot; The Journal Of Sexual Medicine 9.4 (2012): 956-965.

But it's important to remember &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; these Europeans left Europe.  Surely there were a plethora of reasons, but one reason in particular stands out as relevant to this discussion: Religious freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A large number of religious groups emigrated to America over the course of several hundred years, often for the purpose of experiencing greater &quot;religious freedom.&quot; How this &quot;religious freedom&quot; was anticipated and/or played out varied according to each group.  But one prominent example still holds sway, by legacy, over much of American society: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritans&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Puritans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Puritans &quot;sought to reform the Church of England by creating a new, pure church in the New World.&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_history_of_the_United_States#Puritans&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Massachusetts, New Haven, Saybrook, and Connecticut colonies were all founded by Puritans (New Haven and Saybrook were latere absorbed into Connecticut).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Puritans &quot;hoped this new land would serve as a &quot;redeemer nation&quot;. They fled England and in America attempted to create a &quot;nation of saints&quot; or a &quot;City upon a Hill&quot;: an intensely religious, thoroughly righteous community designed to be an example for all of Europe&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Puritan hegemony lasted for at least a century&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritans#New_England_Puritans&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but its indirect influence is still felt today in American culture and politics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers#Immigration_to_North_America&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quakers&lt;/a&gt; also played a significant role in early American colonization, and had significant influence in Pennsylvania (founded by Quaker William Penn), and Rhode Island. (Interestingly, the Quakers fled to the US to avoid Puritan persecution in Europe, only to initially find resistance in the Americas as well, but that's another story...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many other religious groups came in large groups to the Americas, and later to the US, through at least the late 1800s&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-quarterly-the-migration-of-the-russian-germans-to-kansas/13242&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to experience what they perceived as greater religious freedom, or to escape persecution and/or moral depravity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of this to say:  America was, in large part, colonized by Europeans who were not happy with the status quo of European life.  On average, their views on many things were more strict (or &quot;conservative&quot;) than the general population in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This religious fervor, and the moral views that accompany it, naturally had a large and lasting impact.  The campaign in the 1920s and 30s leading to the 18th amendment to the US constitution &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;prohibiting alcohol&lt;/a&gt; was spearheaded by religious people who viewed alcohol as immoral (or at the very least as a sign of immorality).  And to this day, a large portion of US Christians refuse to drink and actively shame those who do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today Evangelical Christians, the Religious Right, and other formal and informal coalitions of conservative Christians have a very strong hold on certain aspects of society and politics.  This naturally extends to attitudes toward sexuality, nudity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;America has a long legacy of being morally restrictive and &quot;conservative,&quot; and while those attitudes are changing, changing such ingrained attitudes is naturally slow. In a way, America is (by its own intention and design, in large part), several hundred years behind Europe in overcoming Victorian morality standards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="64" LastActivityDate="2015-08-09T20:06:44.880" CommentCount="6" />

In reality, orgasms can vary quite a lot in how they&#xA;  feel, how long they last, and how intense they are, based on the&#xA;  duration of stimulation, how the woman feels about her partner or&#xA;  situation, how physically relaxed and mentally comfortable she is, how&#xA;  she feels about the different kinds of stimuli, and a lot of other&#xA;  factors. A woman will experience orgasms very differently if she is&#xA;  tired and tense, or rested and relaxed. And a woman who perceives&#xA;  vaginal sex as boring and oral sex as exciting will experience orgasms&#xA;  from those two sources quite differently from a woman who regards&#xA;  vaginal sex as normal and loving, and oral sex as dirty and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The likelihood of a woman having an orgasm and the nature of the&#xA;  orgasms she does have can both be affected a great deal by factors&#xA;  such as body image issues, whether the lights are on or off, and the&#xA;  degree of confidence she has in the bond with her partner. For&#xA;  example, a woman who feels, consciously or unconsciously, that her&#xA;  private parts are smelly or unattractive may have orgasms from oral&#xA;  sex that she experiences as short, “sharp,” “hard,” or otherwise&#xA;  unpleasant, while the same woman may thoroughly enjoy longer, more&#xA;  mellow, or more intense orgasms from manual stimulation (her own or&#xA;  her partner’s), even though both are “clitoral” orgasms. So the&#xA;  determining factor is not the location of the stimulus so much as it&#xA;  is all of the emotions and preconceptions that are bundled with it,&#xA;  including especially her ideas about different areas of her body and&#xA;  her comfort with her own or her partner’s activities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Given all of the possible influences, it is not surprising that most&#xA;  women experience orgasms differently depending on the circumstances&#xA;  and the sexual activity involved. But there is little consistency as&#xA;  to the differences when women are compared to each other. This has led&#xA;  to passionate debates between those who argue that one kind of&#xA;  orgasmic stimulation is “better” than another, but ultimately the&#xA;  arguments are meaningless. Most women can have better orgasms in some&#xA;  ways than in others, but which way is best, or preferred, for any&#xA;  given woman is almost completely idiosyncratic, and can change&#xA;  dramatically as the setting and circumstances and her own attitudes&#xA;  and experience change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="228" LastActivityDate="2015-08-10T10:18:40.543" CommentCount="13" />

From the few articles I could find that seemed unbiased, there's still a large list of pros and cons. Note that most studies are actually about the &lt;em&gt;long-term&lt;/em&gt; effects of masturbation. Scientists and doctors tend to want to know more about what will happen in twenty years if do something &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, so they can extend your life. I couldn't find a single &lt;em&gt;study&lt;/em&gt; that focused only on the short-term effects, so I'm going to compile what I found here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people (including non-experts, sex therapists, doctors, etc) tend to agree that sufferers of premature ejaculation can try to masturbate before having sex, but that &quot;normal&quot; people, those that can go about five minutes after penetration, should avoid using this technique too frequently, because they would risk not being able to perform. There also was no consensus on the correct timing, which I assume indicates that the correct timing is actually dependent on the person with the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, this technique cannot be considered &quot;reliable.&quot; Some people report less pleasurable sex, inability to perform, no effect, or even a decrease in performance time (e.g. makes premature ejaculation even &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;). Several articles I scanned suggests that masturbation is one of several therapy options for those trying to increase their stamina, including thicker condoms to decrease sensitivity, and therapy (e.g. it may be their mental state causing the problem).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, there's no harm in trying occasionally, but someone trying to do so should experiment for the best results. It may be 30 minutes before an encounter, an hour, or longer, or may require multiple back-to-back orgasms to have the desired effect. There are inherent dangers with masturbating too much and/or having too much sex, so if the person is already quite active (multiple times per day), they should avoid masturbation on top of it, and should probably cut back a little bit. Conversely, if a person is having sex less than once a week, they should probably masturbate a least a couple times a week for health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there's the matter of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it should be done. I'm not referring to a specific motion, but simply that the person should actively concentrate on &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; having an orgasm for as long as possible, otherwise they're not doing their body a favor. A person certainly won't learn to increase their stamina if all they do is work to achieve the fastest &quot;quickie&quot; they can. Time should be allocated before hand and they should work up to a nice, leisurely orgasm over several minutes, perhaps even as much as 30 minutes. Each session should focus on different motions, speeds, and so on to maximize stamina.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that most scientists agree that masturbation can provide a slew of long-term health benefits, including a healthier heart, lungs, muscles, memory, and emotional state (less depressed/sadness). One should consider the wide range of effects that one can benefit from just by masturbating once a week, but shouldn't necessarily expect any performance gains simply by masturbating. Other factors that will improve performance include Kegel exercises, quitting smoking and/or drinking, eating a healthy balanced diet, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="253" LastActivityDate="2015-08-11T04:50:28.970" CommentCount="7" />

A few specific ideas on what this might look like, below.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative Signaling&lt;/strong&gt; - Perhaps instead of approaching partner B, and asking for sex, partner A could place an object somewhere, that's been a pre-arranged signal that partner A is craving sex.  It's then up to partner B to initiate an interaction, which may or may not include sex, but would hopefully at least validate partner A's desire for it.  The signaling might also go the other direction.  Perhaps partner B might have a way to signal that they'd be receptive to approaches from partner A, say.  Or a different signal to say that this would be a poor time for it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduling&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; people find that knowing when this might be coming allows them to plan their mental space, and be more ready for sex.  If partner B is such a person, then perhaps partner A could request a time on the calendar for their next sexual encounter.  Or perhaps there'd be a regular interval set up.  Different people will have different ideas about frequency, amount of warning required, etc., so go back to point #1 and communicate about what might work in this regard.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Masturbation&lt;/strong&gt; - many people find that masturbation can be helpful for resolving sexual tension.  Also, some people find that when watching a partner masturbate, they end up getting turned on, and masturbation turns into sex.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consensual non-monogamy&lt;/strong&gt; - some people with high libidos, for example, find that they can have their sexual desires better filled by having multiple partners.  Some partners of such people feel a great sense of relief when their partner finds (an)other partner(s), because now they're not feeling pressured all the time.  Of course, this is a vast subject unto itself, and offers a variety of challenges to someone not already inclined towards this path.  That said, it's one option that people could explore.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have enough knowledge about what advice sex therapists or relationship counselors might give, so I'm afraid I'm unable to answer that question.  I also don't quite feel qualified to say much about the gender dynamics question, except to say that it's definitely the case that many people do find gender-role dynamics to be relevant in situations like this, even in non-straight couples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the above tips will qualify as a helpful answer to the initial question, though, even if an incomplete one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastActivityDate="2015-08-14T16:10:14.613" CommentCount="0" />

It may be scripted or more organic and free form. A &quot;top&quot; is the person doing the action, and a &quot;bottom&quot; is the person receiving the action. A &quot;safeword&quot; is a signal agreed upon before the start of a scene that immediately stops the scene. This could be used if the bottom is in distress, having a medical issue, or if the top does not think it is safe to proceed with the scene. &quot;Aftercare&quot; is done after a scene to help participants relax and process what happened in the scene. Typical aftercare activities include talking, cuddling, having something to eat or drink, or personal grooming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BDSM may involve sexual pleasure in some cases, but not all. Sexual desires and fantasies may influence the participants, but it is not the only reason it is done. Players may have a casual relationship, or they may be fully committed to each other and the lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consent is integral to BDSM. Many actions and techniques used in BDSM become abusive when one or more partners have not consented to what is happening in the scene.

Are all participants taking steps to reduce the risk of death, injury, and other negative consequences? Are all participants being reasonable in their play, i.e no illegal acts? Are all participants fully aware of what they are agreeing to, and enthusiastically participating of their own free will? If play meets these quidelines, then it is typically deemed acceptable by the community. At public play parties, a &quot;dungeon monitor&quot; is responsible for making these decisions officially and enforcing any rules of the party. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia Article on BDSM&lt;/a&gt; is a good introduction to the practice.
