The same goes for any of the &gt;99% success methods; IUDs share the same problem, to a lesser extent. Is it dependable over the long-term?" />

But Googling a simple term like [**LGBT population rise**][1] (go to images) almost supports this statement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it's true, there might be some reasons that need contemplation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Once something becomes official, more people tend to experience it. Maybe there are millions of people out there who have no idea what is their sexual orientation.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Maybe it's contagious, meaning that a man who's more exposed to gays is more probable to become a gay himself.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Maybe the shift in our food-system and lifestyle has a direct intensification effect on this phenomenon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, do we have any robust statistics and research on this? What causation is explained for it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.google.com/search?q=lgbt%20population%20rise" />

For example, people often talk about getting jittery or irritable if they haven't had sex in a long time, and many athletes believe that abstaining from sex before a game or a match will boost their competitiveness and performance.  Some even suggest that prolonged abstinence in men can increase masculine characteristics, such as deepening the voice, promoting muscle growth, and promoting a more dogmatic, forceful personality.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, while these claims often offer some scientific explanation for the phenomena (usually having to do with fluctuating testosterone levels), they seem to be based more on personal accounts and &quot;common wisdom&quot;, rather than scientific studies or any kind of provable cause-and-effect.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is there any verified evidence that abstinence from sex can affect a person's mood or personality, in a consistent way?

American and European newspapers used the same pic for their stories, but look what they censored (left: Europe, right: USA):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Same pic in American and European newspapers][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;Here are the original Stories (including the same picture):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Story in a Swiss Newspaper][4] (in German Language)  &#xD;&#xA;- [Same story with same picture in an American magazine][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;Why?&#xD;&#xA;-&#xD;&#xA;But why is this? Why are Europe and USA so different in everything that has to do with sexuality? What are the historic reasons?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both regions have similar values in other things. When watching the United States from the European point of view, you see a modern country with highly qualified scientists and the world's best universities, but Americans are dealing with sexuality in a manner, that - measured by European standards - looks somewhat medieval. We Europeans would expect laws that prohibit prostitution in countries where religion is strongly connected with politics, like in Islamic countries, or non-democratic countries where the people is used to be suppressed by their leaders, like Russia or China. (To stay precise: Russia has democracy, but it does not meet Western standards.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why is the United States so prudish (compared to Europe)? Why is Europe so open minded (compared to the USA)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/questions/350/which-was-the-first-locality-to-make-prostitution-illegal&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zk1Ft.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/SadYX.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.blick.ch/news/politik/in-gegenseitigem-einvernehmen-bund-feuert-porno-sekretaerin-id3097187.html&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/swiss-parliament-worker-posted-naked-selfies-office-article-1.1894996" />

Meaning “conventional, of ordinary sexual preferences” is 1970s, from notion of whiteness and the common choice of vanilla ice cream.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Etymological dictionaries tend to work in reverse chronological order, as they describe where words *come* from. So let’s recast this. A Latin word for a sheath, scabbard, or the hull of a plant was inherited into Spanish, where a diminutive (“little pod”) was applied to a certain plant. That plant name came into English where the meaning was expanded to include the flavouring extracted from the beans of the plant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As this flavouring was the default in ice-cream, it was expanded metaphorically to refer to “conventional” or “ordinary” sexual preferences (i.e., non-BDSM).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From there, the term has expanded to various other meanings of conventional, default, or ordinary. In technological circles, for example, *vanilla* means “default, unmodified, standard”. When specifically applied to gaming, for example, it means the default game, without any add-ons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This use of *vanilla* to mean “ordinary” is found in all sorts of contexts, but *in my personal experience* the two most prevalent contexts are the original (sex) and technology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Etymological Sidenote&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Incidentally, the word *vanilla* is etymologically related to *vagina*, but the derivation is completely unrelated to this usage. [They developed independently](http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=738). (*Vagina* was deliberately coined in English from the Latin word for “sheath”; the word was never used in this sense in Latin itself, and has nothing to do with the completely separate derivation of *vanilla* by way of Spanish seed pods.)" />

Meaning “conventional, of ordinary sexual preferences” is 1970s, from notion of whiteness and the common choice of vanilla ice cream.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Etymological dictionaries tend to work in reverse chronological order, as they describe where words *come* from. So let’s recast this. A Latin word for a sheath, scabbard, or the hull of a plant was inherited into Spanish, where a diminutive (“little pod”) was applied to a certain plant. That plant name came into English where the meaning was expanded to include the flavouring extracted from the beans of the plant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As this flavouring was the default in ice-cream, it was expanded metaphorically to refer to “conventional” or “ordinary” sexual preferences (i.e., non-BDSM).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From there, the term has expanded to various other meanings of conventional, default, or ordinary. In technological circles, for example, *vanilla* means “default, unmodified, standard”. When specifically applied to gaming, for example, it means the default game, without any add-ons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This use of *vanilla* to mean “ordinary” is found in all sorts of contexts, but *in my personal experience* the two most prevalent contexts are the original (sex) and technology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Etymological Sidenote&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Incidentally, the word *vanilla* is etymologically related to *vagina*, but the derivation is completely unrelated to this usage. [They developed independently](http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=738). (*Vagina* was deliberately coined in English from the Latin word for “sheath”; the word was never used in this sense in Latin itself, and has nothing to do with the completely separate derivation of *vanilla* by way of Spanish seed pods.)" />

It is also known colloquially as squirting or gushing,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; although these are considered to be different phenomena in some&#xD;&#xA;&gt; research publications.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **The exact source and nature of the fluid continue to be a topic of debate among medical professionals, which is also related to doubts over the existence of the G-spot.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[From other sources](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sexandrelationships/female_ejaculation.htm) :-&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's a controversial subject, not least because pornography writers (most of whom are male) have repeatedly suggested that all women ejaculate at orgasm. This is completely untrue!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reality is that regular ejaculation isn't all that common. Some women do it once in a lifetime, but never again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The actual percentage of females who ejaculate is uncertain. However, in Masters and Johnson's famous lab experiments with over 400 women, they did not record anyone who ejaculated at climax.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What research has been done on the fluid?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There hasn't been enough research on the fluid (ejaculate) – partly because it's difficult to obtain adequate supplies of it for investigation. Also, large scientific funds tend to be available for life-threatening diseases rather than for sexual problems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, recent research suggests the ejaculate is an alkaline liquid that isn't like urine, because it doesn't contain urea or creatinine, which are normal urinary constituents. The fluid tends to be clear coloured and doesn't stain bedclothes yellow – again, unlike urine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Researchers have claimed that it contains some chemical ingredients similar to those produced by the male prostate – notably PSA (prostate-specific antigen). It is also said to contain two sugars: glucose and fructose.&#xD;&#xA;Since 2000, an increasing number of researchers have suggested the liquid may be the secretion of Skene's glands (the paraurethral glands). These are tiny structures which lie around the female urethra (the urinary pipe).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In 2007, Viennese researcher Dr Florian Wimpissinger published an important study on two women who habitually ejaculated. (Incidentally, this surname is not some sort of joke! Dr Wimpissinger genuinely is a well-known urologist in Vienna.) He and his colleagues found that the ejaculate from these two females was chemically very different from that of their urine.&#xD;&#xA;In particular, it contained more prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), more prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and also some glucose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Some other resources' views :-][1] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Previous experiments ignored the physical source of the copious fluid. But,lately, in 2015, the researchers took it one step further by performing ultrasounds before and after ejaculation, as well as testing the biochemical properties of the liquid. It turned out that not only is it chemically identical to urine, but the bladder emptied during the period of ejaculation coinciding with orgasm. It’s probably just pee after all!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**THEIR CONCLUSIONS:** The present data based on ultrasonographic bladder monitoring and biochemical analyses indicate that squirting is essentially the involuntary emission of urine during sexual activity, although a marginal contribution of prostatic secretions to the emitted fluid often exists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How much fluid is produced?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I(not me, the previous source's author) have heard claims that highly-sexed women can produce litres of fluid in a single orgasm.

(I know this from [personal experience](http://christianity.blogoverflow.com/2012/03/05/an-evangelical-view-of-contraception/).) Choosing a birth control method is something partners should agree upon together and there are a lot of factors beyond mere effectiveness to consider.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Condoms have some unique attributes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Disease prevention, which you mentioned, is important when one partner might risk exposing the other to infection.&#xD;&#xA;2.  Unlike most other birth control, condoms can be managed entirely by a male partner.&#xD;&#xA;3. Condoms can be layered with other forms of birth control to provide [defence in depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_in_depth).&#xD;&#xA;4. Sex can be messy and condoms are useful in containing semen.&#xD;&#xA;5. Some condoms are built with extra features designed to enhance sensations felt by the female partner.&#xD;&#xA;6. Condoms are fairly easy to obtain and don't require as much lead time to prepare as other methods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the downside, many people (both male and female) find condoms uncomfortable and awkward. Since condoms are also one-time-use and aren't usually covered by health insurance, they can be more expensive than other methods. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/unintendedpregnancy/contraception.htm) condoms are not particularly effective. Much of the typical failure rate stems from [human error](http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/explanation-condom-failure-rates). (There is also a failure rate for disease prevention.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If effectiveness is your top priority and both partners are ok with the downsides of condoms, there's no reason not to use them in conjunction with other methods (see #3 above). But many couples in the situation you describe do not find the extra pregnancy prevention worthwhile. This is something partners need to discuss and find some agreement on their own." />

Avoid heavy panting.)&#xD;&#xA; - Stop and Start Method (Don't go full speed the whole time.)&#xD;&#xA; - Squeeze Methods (Apparently, squeezing your head will keep yourself from getting too stimulated. ???  Mantak Chia's books on Taoist Sexuality have some exercises fitting this description.)&#xD;&#xA; - Sexual positions  (If there's a position you find powerfully erotic, maybe save that one for last.)&#xD;&#xA; - Pelvic exercises (Kegels for men)&#xD;&#xA; - Desensitizing cream (Like it says)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note: posting this link should not in any way be interpreted as recommending any products or services being offered on that website.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This list is from personal experience.  I'm asssuming that you are a man having sex with a woman.  Accept my apologies if some of this does not apply to you.  If appropriate, I will revise my answer accordingly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A history of masturbation has helped but not in the way the article describes.  It's helped me become familiar with the many subtle stages of my own arousal.  I'll gradually build up and get close to climaxing, then back off and relax and let myself become less aroused, then repeat.  (I found out later that this is apparently called &quot;edging&quot;, and you can find resources online.)&#xD;&#xA; - Stop and Start is pretty important.  You can build your partner's arousal while slowing yours down.&#xD;&#xA;  - Very regularly, I will stop thrusting and just kiss or even just hug my partner for a while.&#xD;&#xA;  - You can also pull out and slide your partner's clitoris up and down the shaft of your penis or rub your penis over her clitoris in a windshield wiper motion.&#xD;&#xA;  - Many women love receiving oral sex.  It's not unusual for a woman to enjoy oral sex **more** than vaginal sex.  It's easy to go down on a woman and give yourself time to cool off.&#xD;&#xA; - Breathing and relaxation, along with start-and-stop, are important tools for managing my level of arousal.  I've studied Yoga, meditation and relaxation techniques, and I've trained myself to relax quickly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The format of this list makes it difficult for me to spell out every detail.  If you're unsure about what would work best for your partner, **ask her**.  If neither of you are sure, then experiment and find out together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good luck!" />

So if you are having difficulty reaching&#xD;&#xA;&gt; orgasm with a partner, try clitoral stimulation during, before, or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; after vaginal intercourse or oral sex. Masturbation can also be an&#xD;&#xA;&gt; important step in learning to be orgasmic with a partner. Once you&#xD;&#xA;&gt; have discovered what type of touch and stimulation you enjoy, you will&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be better able to give your partner(s) helpful directions.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If it appeals to you, oral sex can be one of the most effective ways&#xD;&#xA;&gt; for women to reach orgasm. Having your partner use their mouth and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; tongue to stimulate the vulva in general and the clitoris in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; particular can be very arousing and can help you to orgasm. The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sensitivity of your vulva and clitoris will determine what type of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; oral stimulation you enjoy and are most responsive to, so there is no&#xD;&#xA;&gt; one approach that works for everyone and new partners will need to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; learn about each other’s bodies and preferences." />

Sperm cells are produced by the testicles, travel down the vas deferens, and mix with the semen, assuming they aren't blocked by a vasectomy or the equivalent.  *Semen* - the whitish liquid you ejaculate - is produced primarily in the prostate and the seminal vesicles, with contributions from other glands.  Semen can contain 0-5% sperm by volume. [http://www.britannica.com/topic/semen] But the amount of sperm won't make any difference for the question I think you *intended* to ask, which is whether &quot;edging&quot; and non-ejaculatory orgasms are harmful. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And the answer to that question is no, they are not. The semen remains where it is, waiting for your next ejaculation, just as if you had done nothing to stimulate yourself.  If becoming aroused for extended periods without release did harm, millions of teenage boys would be crippling themselves by making out for hours without release.  And I've personally interviewed two dozen men, including my own partner, who have deliberately had dry orgasms regularly over many years, in some cases for more than 25 years, without any harm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since you asked this in the context of men who are trying to become multi-orgasmic, it's probably worth expanding on that simple &quot;no&quot; answer to include information related to that topic. It starts with the difference between orgasm and ejaculation. Although male orgasms and ejaculation *usually* go together, they are not the same thing.  Under certain circumstances men can have an orgasm without an ejaculation, just as boys do before semenarche, and they can have an ejaculation without an orgasm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An orgasm begins in the central nervous system. Within 1-3 seconds of onset, the orgasm triggers the ejaculatory process in the nerves and muscles of the pelvic region, creating waves of muscular contractions that force the semen down the urethra and out.  If you are male, you may recognize the actual onset of the orgasm in your brain as a feeling of inevitability, &quot;the point of no return,&quot; followed moments later by the onset of ejaculation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A few men have the ability to suppress the ejaculation signal purely by mental choice. In all cases I know of, these men masturbated to orgasm frequently as boys, before reaching semenarche, and they somehow retained the ability to select which kind of orgasm to have. However, most men who can voluntarily have &quot;dry&quot; (nonejaculatory) orgasms have learned to use a strong, extended  contraction of the pubococcygeal (or &quot;kegel&quot;) muscles just before or at the onset of orgasm to suppress the ejaculation signal. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Note that this actually interrupts the signal and prevents the internal contractions, it does not just block the expulsion of semen. There is a third technique for preventing ejaculation that does involve physically blocking the urethra with fingers or a hard object.  This is entirely different in mechanism and effect, because it does NOT prevent the ejaculatory contractions from taking place.  Instead, these fairly forceful contractions occur, but the semen is physically prevented from moving forward.  As a result, the semen is often forced backward into the bladder (called &quot;retrograde ejaculation&quot;).  Blocking the urethra like this is dangerous and can lead to damage to the urethra or the prostate or both.  It is not uncommon to see blood as well as semen in the urine afterward.]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some source material from [an article][1] I wrote awhile ago:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For a very long time, all Western writers about sex stated&#xD;&#xA;&gt; unequivocally that a man could not have an orgasm without an&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ejaculation, and that every man had to wait through a recovery (or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “refractory”) period after one orgasm before he could get another&#xD;&#xA;&gt; erection and have another orgasm. A few dabblers in Eastern religion&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and sexual practices came across clues that this wasn’t necessarily&#xD;&#xA;&gt; true, but it wasn’t until Alfred Kinsey’s pioneering study, Sexual&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Behavior in the Human Male, in 1948, that there was a hint that some&#xD;&#xA;&gt; normal men didn’t follow the supposed rules.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Kinsey noted that, out of the thousands of American men he studied, a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; few reported experiencing orgasm without ejaculation, and being able&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to have multiple orgasms in a row as a result. Because “everyone knew”&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that this was impossible, it was largely ignored, or dismissed either&#xD;&#xA;&gt; as a reporting error or as men simply exaggerating their sexual&#xD;&#xA;&gt; prowess. The same thing happened in 1966 when Masters and Johnson&#xD;&#xA;&gt; mentioned the possibility of male orgasms without ejaculation in their&#xD;&#xA;&gt; landmark book, Human Sexual Response, even though they were relying on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; laboratory studies, not self-reports or surveys.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; In 1978, two researchers published a paper describing interviews with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; several multi-orgasmic men (M. Robbins, G. Jensen; &quot;Multiple Orgasm in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Males,&quot; Journal of Sex Research, vol. 14, no. 1; 1978), but again&#xD;&#xA;&gt; there was little attention paid to it. It was not until 1984, when&#xD;&#xA;&gt; William Hartman and Marilyn Fithian published their how-to guide, Any&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Man Can, that members of the general public became aware that the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; conventional wisdom was wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hartman and Fithian were among the most respected sex researchers of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; their era. They recorded extraordinary amounts of data during more&#xD;&#xA;&gt; than 10,000 hours of observation and recordings of more than 750&#xD;&#xA;&gt; subjects masturbating and having sex in their Los Angeles lab, still a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; record in the field.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Among their 282 male subjects, they found 33 who could have anywhere&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from 2 to 16 orgasms in a row without losing their erections. (Orgasms&#xD;&#xA;&gt; were defined and determined by recording and measuring the rapid&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increases in the heart rate and the involuntary contractions of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; anal sphincter and pelvic muscles.) These 33 men averaged four orgasms&#xD;&#xA;&gt; per session, which was typically 20-30 minutes, with the record held&#xD;&#xA;&gt; by a young man who had 16 consecutive orgasms in less than an hour, an&#xD;&#xA;&gt; average of less than 4 minutes for each one!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; In 1989, Marion Dunn and Jan Trost, researchers in New York, published&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a study of 21 multiply orgasmic men. They found “*that detumescence&#xD;&#xA;&gt; does not always follow an orgasm, that a nonejaculatory orgasm can&#xD;&#xA;&gt; occur prior to as well as after an ejaculatory orgasm, and that it is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; possible to have a series of orgasms. Some of the men reported always&#xD;&#xA;&gt; having been multiply orgasmic, whereas others experienced it&#xD;&#xA;&gt; relatively late in life. Others have actively learned to become&#xD;&#xA;&gt; multiply orgasmic.*” Of these, eight were men who learned to become&#xD;&#xA;&gt; multi-orgasmic after age 35.  (&quot;Male multiple orgasms: a descriptive&#xD;&#xA;&gt; study.&quot; Dunn,  Marion E; Trost,  Jan E, Arch Sex Behav. 1989&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Oct;18(5):377-87.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;edging&quot; process described in the question is commonly used by men who are learning to recognize the onset of orgasm with sufficient accuracy to use the kegel method to control ejaculation.  If you maintain a high level of arousal for too long, it can cause the painful pelvic congestion called &quot;blue balls,&quot; so it's a good idea to continue to the point of ejaculation after an hour or two.  (Experiment to find the time period you find works for you.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Men who use the kegel technique to orgasm without ejaculation typically have a series of dry orgasms followed by an ejaculatory orgasm, so they don't have the pelvic congestion problem.  However, &quot;blue balls&quot; are merely uncomfortable; in spite of what some teenage boys would like girls to believe, they are not actually harmful or dangerous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://moderntantra.blogspot.com/2013/11/multiple-orgasms-for-men-some-history.html" />

However, we are finding that a surprising number of partnered individuals are not even striving to maintain a monogamous relationship. Our recent studies with American samples have demonstrated that approximately 4% to 5% of people are currently involved in consensually non-monogamous (CNM) relationships—that is, relationships in which both partners have openly agreed that they and/or their partners will have other sexual or romantic partners (Conley, Moors, Matsick, &amp; Ziegler, 2011, 2012a; Moors, Edelstein, &amp; Conley, 2012).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The citations are the paper above, unpublished data and a conference talk they gave in Chicago.

If an egg has already been released (depending on where you are in your cycle when you take the pill), it may also interfere with the fertilization of the egg.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Morning after pills basically contain a high dose of Progestin, which is the same hormone found in lower doses in birth control pills that are meant to be taken daily. If you plan on having unprotected sex regularly, it's safer (meaning that you will be less likely to become pregnant) if you take regular birth control pills to keep a more constant supply of Progestin in your system, rather than taking a morning after pill every time you have sex. &#xD;&#xA;(Also, neither of these protect against STDs; they provide protection against pregnancy only).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's also worth noting that if the egg has already been fertilized, and that fertilized egg has had time to implant itself in the woman's uterus, the morning after pill will have no effect. You can take the pill up to 72 hours after having sex, so it doesn't have to be taken &quot;the morning after&quot;, but the sooner the better.

However, like other types of intercourse that the body is not naturally designed for (such as urethral intercourse), it may take some time to actually be able to have anal intercourse without pain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Relaxation&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first of two problems has to do with the sphincter muscle. It's basically permanently closed by default, and only after learning to control it can a person will it to allow foreign objects. Normally, this control is only subconscious, like breathing or heart rate, but we can control it to some extent by exercising it regularly. This is done by starting with small objects that are phallus-shaped, such as &quot;sounds&quot;, which are gauged to each increasingly larger sizes as you go up. I recommend using only sanitized toys that are designed for the purpose of sexual exploration, not candles, batteries, pens, or other objects that have other purposes. They can have sharp edges that can cut or stab.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Find a toy that gives an &quot;uncomfortable&quot; feeling, like you really need to defecate, but instead of trying to push it out, focus on letting it stay there. That focus will give you control over the muscle, allowing it to relax. If done right, you'll notice that after a few minutes it seems to be more comfortable. You can experiment fairly safely in the &quot;uncomfortable&quot; zone without harm. Once that toy is like second nature, you can move up to the next &quot;uncomfortable&quot; size. I'd suggest at least fifteen minutes at each level before continuing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You'll notice that after a few minutes of playing with an object that &quot;barely fits&quot;, will slide in and out without any problems once your body has accommodated for it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Stretching&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other important factor is that the entire region has a lining much like skin. If you stretch it too quickly, you'll create a tear, which causes bleeding, hemorrhaging, and other unpleasant side effects. A severe enough tear will need medical attention, and you'll have to explain what you were doing. I'm pretty sure the ER doctors don't want to have to explore a rectum any more than you want to have it explored with surgical tools.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like other body parts, such as skin, earlobes, and the urethra, you can slowly stretch this body part out over time. By stretching it just to the point where it feels very uncomfortable, but not painful (it *feels* like its stretching), you're actually creating micro-tears in the tissue. This is permanent &quot;damage,&quot; and will heal quickly, but the tissue will be permanently larger than it was before. As you can imagine, you can continue to create micro-tears, allowing several days for healing between each attempt, to allow nearly unbelievable stretching. See &quot;goatse&quot; on Google Images, and you'll see what I'm talking about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you're experimenting with increasing size, pay attention to the feeling. There's the uncomfortable bit of of allowing the muscles to relax, and there's a completely different feeling of stretching when you're at your physical limit. That stretching must be done carefully, and in a controlled manner, or you'll cause some serious damage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Myths: Incontinence&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may have heard that anal stretching and/or intercourse leads to incontinence later in life. The two events appear largely uncorrelated by most serious studies, as the sphincter will generally do its job of holding feces in until you let loose-- if it was going to happen, it was going to happen anyways, regardless of any stretching you may have done earlier in life. The muscle generally &quot;grows old&quot; and fails to do its job as well as it used to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Myths: Pain&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many people will say that anal intercourse must have some pain because you're rubbing nerves the wrong way. This simply isn't true. Those nerves are telling you that you're doing damage you'll regret later when you feel pain. Normally, you should simply feel &quot;like you have to go&quot;, which means the nerves are simulated, but not in any actual danger of damage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anal intercourse can be pleasurable for both partners if done with patience and love. It will take weeks, months, or even years, depending on the initial condition of the anus involved and the size (particularly girth) of the penis being inserted, before it can be attempted without pain, but after enough experience, anal intercourse can even be done with nothing more than precum or a single drop of lubricant, and a few minutes of playing around. Anyone who tells you otherwise hasn't taken the time, or &quot;training,&quot; required to actually reach that point. This path isn't for those without patience, because it will take dedication to get there." />

However, it is not a problem of stretching as it is a matter of muscle control. The vagina isn't just a flab of skin or issue, it's a big, powerful muscle. Like all muscles, it gets stronger when exercised regularly, weaker if it's not exercised regularly, can be &quot;trained&quot; like other muscles, and can be damaged.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If damaged from extreme abuse (including possibly child birth), the vagina may never be able to contract as tight as it used to. This can lead to the sensation referred to as being &quot;stretched out.&quot; In all other cases, exercise can restore it back to its normal size over time. Generally speaking, with proper care and exercise, there's no reason why a vagina that is fisted regularly will not eventually reach normal size after a period of inactivity. The same thing occurs after a period of sexual inactivity, where it takes significant more lube/patience/effort to have intercourse after taking a break for a few months.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming no pain was involved in the fisting, and the vagina is youthful enough to recover, the vagina should eventually bounce back to its smaller self. Age is an important factor, as it will take longer to recover the older the person is and the longer they've been practicing fisting. In the case of older people, you may as well consider the effect permanent. There's no exact age limit when the effect can't be easily reversed (depends on genes, health, etc), but probably lies between the late twenties to early forties." />

The only exceptionally foolproof method is to abstain from all physical contact with other humans, including kissing, heavy petting, and of course, actually having sex.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, there is a vaccination available that can increase the chance that your immune system will fight it off should you catch it.

There's no cure for it, but unlike AIDS, it doesn't have billions of dollars being funneled into research, because it's also relatively harmless, unlike HIV/AIDS, which is pretty much a death sentence without treatment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Much like the common cold or influenza, your best option to avoid catching either is to avoid people that may be carriers, which is 100% of the human population; you simply can't know if someone is a carrier, even if they are a virgin. Promiscuous people certainly take a chance every time they try someone new, but, much like getting pregnant (in the sense that the first time you have semen inside a vagina a pregnancy could happen, even without a first period), merely losing your virginity or experimenting with another's genitals or mouth, even once, can infect you for life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, there's over 600,000 heart-related deaths in the United States in a given year, but virtually no deaths from complications with HSV or HPV (e.g. cancer), meaning you should really be more worried about exercise, diet, nutrition, and dental health than you should about catching a disease that you can't really do anything about if you get it, won't suffer from for more than a few days (unless you're just plain unlucky), and (for HPV) can fight off simply by being healthy." />

There's no test for HPV, and it could even have been transmitted from non-sex activities, such as child birth.&#xA;&#xA;However, compared to some diseases, such as HIV, the mortality rate for both diseases in the question is significantly lower, even without treatment. That's not to say that any particular person might not die from it, it's simply not as guaranteed as with some more potent diseases.&#xA;&#xA;There are steps that one can take to reduce the risk significantly, but never eliminate it, except as noted above. Avoid contact with people you don't know well, don't trust well, or are known to be high risk takers. If you haven't had the HPV vaccination, do get it, as it may very well save your life. Also, obviously, don't have sexual contact with anyone that has any symptoms or have ever been known to have symptoms. Prefer partners that prefer low risk individuals.&#xA;&#xA;You shouldn't worry about HPV and HSV, in particular, compared to diseases with a higher mortality rate than these diseases.

The release of prolactin is linked to the feeling of sexual satisfaction, and it also mediates the “recovery time” that men are well aware of—the time a guy must wait before “giving it another go.” Studies have also shown that men deficient in prolactin have faster recovery times.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  [1]: http://m.livescience.com/32445-why-do-guys-get-sleepy-after-sex.html" />

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_balls):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Blue balls is a slang term for the condition of temporary fluid congestion (vasocongestion) in the testicles accompanied by testicular pain, caused by prolonged sexual arousal in the human male without ejaculation. The term is thought to have originated in the United States, first appearing in 1916. Some urologists call the condition &quot;epididymal hypertension&quot;. The condition is not experienced by all males.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But if your husband is &quot;taking care of himself,&quot; then there's clearly no need for concern, as ejaculation (whether due to intercourse, masturbation, or a &quot;wet dream&quot;) will &quot;cure&quot; blue balls.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for your question of &quot;does it hurt that much?&quot;--that's pretty difficult to answer. What is &quot;that much&quot;?  Does it hurt? From personal experience, yes.  How much? More than a mosquito bite, less than falling off a bicycle." />

The FC2 is a soft, flexible nitrile tube with two retainer rings.  The smaller one holds the closed end of the tube inside while the larger one keeps the open end outside.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The FC2 is just okay as a vaginal condom, but where it really stars is in anal sex.  Whether you're using toys, fingers, or penis, using the FC2 is much more sanitary and much more enjoyable than going bare.  It's also much less likely to get lost inside the rectum than a regular condom. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When used for full penile penetration, the friction is between his penis and the lubricated inside of the FC2, instead of being between the condom and the recipient's anus/rectum, which is much harder to lubricate properly.  So both people get more pleasure with the FC2 and the &quot;bottom&quot; is protected against abrasion and pain from being underlubed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can't use a regular condom and an FC2 at the same time, but if you're an M/F couple with clean tests and you're using something other than condoms for birth control, one of the greatest things about the FC2 is that it lets you switch back and forth between anal and vaginal penetration without having to stop to sanitize fingers or cocks, so it gives you much more flexibility and lets long sex sessions be much more spontaneous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More details and tips [here][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://moderntantra.blogspot.com/p/better-sex-101_21.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.amazon.com/FC2-Female-Condom-Quantity-Pack/dp/B001GKK4AY/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://moderntantra.blogspot.com/2015/01/mailbag-5-tantra-for-women-and-fc2-for.html" />

Clearly there's some sort of locker room status competition going on among males, but women typically find the whole thing very strange. A few women do fetishize size, but most women who have experienced the extremes have a strong preference for a penis somewhere within the normal &quot;Goldilocks&quot; range - not too big and not too small.  Within that fairly broad range, there seems to be almost no correlation between penis size and sexual satisfaction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As Amy Muise says in [Supersize Me: Does Penis Size Matter to Women?][1]...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Researchers have also explored how women feel about their partner’s&#xD;&#xA;&gt; penis size. Most women rated their partner’s penis size as average&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (67%), about a quarter rated their partner’s penis as large (27%), and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a few women rated their partner’s penis as small (6%). &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Importantly, the vast majority of women were satisfied with their&#xD;&#xA;&gt; partner’s penis size (84%), and this was a significantly higher&#xD;&#xA;&gt; percentage than the number of men who were satisfied with their own&#xD;&#xA;&gt; penis size (55%). Only 14% of women wanted their partner’s penis to be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; larger, and, in fact, 2% wanted their partner’s penis to be smaller.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Data from: Lever, J., Frederick, D. A., &amp; Peplau, L. A. (2006). Does size matter? Men’s and women’s views on penis size across the lifespan. Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity, 7, 129-143.]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Porn is clearly a major cause of male insecurity, since it creates a grossly exaggerated idea of what is normal.  This is reinforced by the steady drumbeat of penis enlargement ads that claim that 7&quot; is the average erect length, when in fact average is ~5.2&quot; and 7&quot; is above the 98th percentile level. (See [&quot;A systematic review of penis length and circumference in 15,521 men,&quot; BJUI][2].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What's strange about the whole thing is that, given equal levels of confidence and skill, a straight man is more likely to be rejected as a sexual partner for having a penis that is too large than for having one that is too small.  See &quot;[HOW MUCH DOES PENIS SIZE MATTER?][3]&quot; for discussion and some typical responses; the practical reality is that there are many ways to compensate for small size, but it is very difficult for a woman to accommodate a penis that is simply too big.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a more general sense, the media's barrage of images of Photoshopped perfection and something about the idealization of bodies in our culture have combined to create high levels of body-image insecurity in both men and women.  Penis size seems to be just one area of focus for this obsessive insecurity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.scienceofrelationships.com/home/2012/6/15/supersize-me-does-penis-size-matter-to-women.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bju.13010/abstract&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://moderntantra.blogspot.com/p/penis-size.html" />

Quite simply, anything that directly improves the chance of conception tends to be strongly selected, and the hit-or-miss nature of the female orgasm, and the very high numbers of women who seldom or never have orgasms during vaginal sex, would both argue that no such evolutionary advantage exists. If the female orgasm made a significant difference to conception rates, it would be at least as common and reliable as the male orgasm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347213002121" />

Apply the same restrictions to kissing and sharing food or utensils that you would apply to sex.   Wash your hands often and keep them away from your face. In short, behave like a germaphobe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That sounds old-fashioned, boring, and restrictive, and it clearly is unacceptable to many people, which is why these viruses are endemic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oral herpes (HSV-1) is a very common, but relatively minor problem.  Genital herpes (HSV-2) is substantially more aggravating, but rarely life-threatening. HPV is a collection of ~100 viruses that are also common, and some of them can cause serious illnesses, including cancers of the cervix, penis, throat, tongue, anus, and related areas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The big problem with both HPV and HSV, compared to more dangerous STDs like syphilis and HIV, is that condoms are of limited use in protecting against infection.  You can get them from kissing, oral sex, and even external contact with the area around the genitals, mouth, and anus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The University of Maryland Medical Center has [a good summary on herpes][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; HSV-1 is the main cause of herpes infections on the mouth and lips,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; including cold sores and fever blisters. It is transmitted through&#xD;&#xA;&gt; kissing or sharing drinking glasses and utensils. HSV-1 can also cause&#xD;&#xA;&gt; genital herpes, although HSV-2 is the main cause of genital herpes.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; HSV-2 is spread through sexual contact. You may be infected with HSV-1&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or HSV-2 but not show any symptoms. Often symptoms are triggered by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; exposure to the sun, fever, menstruation, emotional stress, a weakened&#xD;&#xA;&gt; immune system, or an illness. There is no cure for herpes, and once&#xD;&#xA;&gt; you have it, it is likely to come back. However, some people may have&#xD;&#xA;&gt; one outbreak and then never have another one. In between herpes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; outbreaks, the virus lies dormant (as if it is hibernating or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sleeping) in nerve cells.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Exposure to HSV-1 is extremely common -- as many as 90% of American&#xD;&#xA;&gt; adults have been exposed to the virus -- and there is no stigma to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; having a cold sore.  However, HSV-2, or genital herpes, can cause&#xD;&#xA;&gt; embarrassment. Although there is no cure for genital herpes, an&#xD;&#xA;&gt; infected person can take steps to prevent spreading the disease and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; can continue to have a normal sex life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In spite of the names, HSV-1 can cause genital infections and HSV-2 can cause oral infections:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; HSV-1 is spread through saliva. Kissing, using the same eating&#xD;&#xA;&gt; utensils, sharing personal items (such as a razor), and receiving oral&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sex from someone who has HSV-1 can cause you to contract the virus.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; HSV-2 is sexually transmitted.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Until recently, scientists assumed that HSV-1 infections were not&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sexually transmitted. Now, scientists know that either type can be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; found in either the oral or genital area, as well as at other sites.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In fact, researchers estimate that HSV-1 is responsible for up to half&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of all new cases of genital herpes.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To infect people, HSV-1 and HSV-2 must get into the body through&#xD;&#xA;&gt; broken skin or a mucous membrane, such as inside the mouth or in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; genital area. In addition to the fluid from fever blisters, each virus&#xD;&#xA;&gt; can be carried in bodily fluids like saliva, semen, and fluid in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; female genital tract.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Both herpes viruses may cause genital infections, and both can be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; contagious even if the infected person does not have active symptoms&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or visible blisters.&#xD;&#xA;[Ibid.]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;HPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease.  Most Americans have had it and didn't know it.  It is transmitted through oral sex as well as vaginally and anally, and condoms provide only partial protection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;HPV can cause oral, anal, and genital cancers, warts, and a variety of other unpleasant problems.  These effects sometimes take years to show up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; While there is no cure for HPV, the good news is the infection often&#xD;&#xA;&gt; clears on its own. If it does not, and treatment is needed, there are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; many HPV treatment options. Plus, as more people are vaccinated with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the new HPV vaccines, the rates of infection may be greatly reduced.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; For now, HPV treatment focuses on the symptoms of the infection.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Symptoms include genital warts associated with low-risk HPV types&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (which don't generally lead to cancers) and the precancerous changes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sometimes associated with the high-risk types of HPV.&#xD;&#xA;Source: [WebMD][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are around a hundred strains of HPV; the Gardasil vaccine protects against HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18, the most common and dangerous ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;HPV is believed to be responsible for about 5% of all cancers worldwide.  If you are 25 or under and haven't received the Gardasil HPV vaccine, get it now! Make sure you get all three shots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are a parent, be sure your daughters AND your sons get all three shots, preferably in 6th grade, or as soon as possible after that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ref:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[CDC: STD Facts - Human papillomavirus virus (HPV)][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[CDC: Genital HSV Infections][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/herpes-simplex-virus#ixzz3hg4fgkkQ&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/hpv-genital-warts/hpv-treatment-is-there-hpv-cure&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/herpes.htm" />

Sometimes the cervix seems to disappear – which just means it has become so soft that it blends in with the vagina walls and rises so high that the finger cannot touch it. This is known as SHOW - soft, high, open and wet. This is your most fertile time and is the optimal time to have sex to achieve pregnancy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;--Once ovulation occurs, the cervix drops lower and becomes more firm - once again feeling like the tip of your nose. The opening to the uterus will become tightly closed. This can happen immediately after ovulation or may take several hours to several days.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;--When pregnancy occurs, the cervix will rise up and become soft, yet the os will remain tightly closed.

Broken legs, toes, fingers, even two fractures in the floor of my eye socket, couldn't compete with the pain of blueballs.  The sensation of a bruised coccyx (tailbone) is close in intensity, but not as enduring.  I gave myself a horrible burn with hot oil (I'm a professional chef), all the way up my left arm, but it didn't come close to the agony of blueballs. No cut, no matter how serious or deep, has hurt as much as blueballs.  None of my several concussions have even begun to approach the amount of discomfort caused by blueballs.  It is a sensation which is unique in both nature and intensity.  Some things hurt far worse than blueballs, but in my personal experience, nothing hurts in the same way as blueballs (a hard blow to the testicles causes a similar kind of pain, and at first it is probably worse than blueballs, but it dissipates far more quickly).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The sensation is impossible to describe, but it is very intense and it lasts for quite some time - hours at the very least.  Walking becomes difficult, the pain seems to be unrelenting, and, in my own experience, there is a correlation between blueballs and diarrhea (although I have been led to believe that this is fairly unique, and I don't understand how the two conditions are related).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's the bad news.  Here's the good news:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Blueballs are pretty hard to get, fortunately.  When teenage boys are in the throes of puberty, they get blueballs at the drop of a hat, but as they get older and their hormones calm down, the frequency of blueball incidents drops off dramatically.  By the time they are adults, it takes a lot to give men blueballs:  intense heavy petting, prolonged periods of &quot;dry humping&quot;, manual stimulation, etc.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point is that, for most adult males, blueballs are relatively easy to avoid, because it takes a lot of intense foreplay (or something like it) to get a man worked up enough to make blueballs a real possibility.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Masturbation does help to alleviate the symptoms somewhat, especially if you address the problem early on, but nothing - not even sex - can erase the pain altogether once blueball status has been achieved.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wouldn't worry too much about your husband's suffering, because it is temporary and probably not as serious as menstrual pains, but especially because he should be able to control how worked up he lets himself become.  If you are being forthcoming about not being in the mood, and he still gets himself all hot and bothered, he has only himself to blame.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, you aren't to blame for your husband's apparent lack of self control, and as far as I know, there are no long term health effects related to frequent blueball episodes.  It's probably no more serious than any other situational pain not caused by an actual injury.  It is very uncomfortable, but not really harmful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Note:  I'm hesitant to say this, because as I have already said, under no circumstances should anyone ever try to coerce, cajole, or guilt trip someone into having sex against their will, and by the same token, *you aren't obligated to do anything to prevent your husband from getting himself so excited that he ends up with blueballs*.&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;However, I don't think it is going too far to say this:  **The most you can do is to make sure he knows when he isn't going to get any, so he doesn't get himself all riled up**.  But again, it isn't your responsibility to make sure he doesn't get carried away.&lt;/sub&gt;" />

By the time they are adults, it takes a lot to give men blueballs:  intense heavy petting, prolonged periods of &quot;dry humping&quot;, manual stimulation, etc.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point is that, for most adult males, blueballs are relatively easy to avoid, because it takes a lot of intense foreplay (or something like it) to get a man worked up enough to make blueballs a real possibility.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Masturbation does help to alleviate the symptoms somewhat, especially if you address the problem early on, but nothing - not even sex - can erase the pain altogether once blueball status has been achieved.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wouldn't worry too much about your husband's suffering, because it is temporary and probably not as serious as menstrual pains, but especially because he should be able to control how worked up he lets himself become.  If you are being forthcoming about not being in the mood, and he still gets himself all hot and bothered, he has only himself to blame.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, you aren't to blame for your husband's apparent lack of self control, and as far as I know, there are no long term health effects related to frequent blueball episodes.  It's probably no more serious than any other situational pain not caused by an actual injury.  It is very uncomfortable, but not really harmful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Note:  I'm hesitant to say this, because as I have already said, under no circumstances should anyone ever try to coerce, cajole, or guilt trip someone into having sex against their will, and by the same token, *you aren't obligated to do anything to prevent your husband from getting himself so excited that he ends up with blueballs*.&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;However, I don't think it is going too far to say this:  **The most you can do is to make sure he knows when he isn't going to get any, so he doesn't get himself all riled up**.  But again, it isn't your responsibility to make sure he doesn't get carried away.&lt;/sub&gt;" />

Your husband is causing the problems, not you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#The Technical Data: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are at least two medical terms for blueballs:  &quot;Testicular Vasocongestion&quot; and &quot;Epididymal Hypertension&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From an [article](http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/epididymal-hypertension-blue-balls) found on the University of California at Santa Barbara website:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;What Causes Epididymal Hypertension?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;When a man becomes sexually aroused, the arteries that carry blood to his genitals enlarge, while the veins that leave the genital area constrict, allowing less blood to escape. This uneven rate of blood flow increases the quantity and pressure of blood flow and traps it in the genital area. This pressure is responsible for producing an erection and making the testes swell to be 25-50% larger than their normal size. If an orgasm is achieved, the blood vessels will return to their normal size and the volume of blood in the genitals quickly returns to its normal level. By contrast, if a man does not have an orgasm, blood in the genitals builds up through a process called vasogongestion and may create sensations of heaviness, aching, or discomfort.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Epididymal hypertension usually does not last long and often the pain associated with blue balls is minor.  Many men may become frustrated when they get an erection during sexual activity, but do not achieve orgasm. This frustration and failure to ejaculate can add psychological stress to physical discomfort, making blue balls seem even worse. Men who feel pressure to ejaculate every time that they are aroused may attempt to coerce an unwilling partner into participating in sexual activity leading to his own climax.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;How is Epididymal Hypertension Treated?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The simplest remedy for blue balls is orgasm and ejaculation. Masturbation is often the most viable way to achieve this orgasm, especially if one's partner does not want to have sex. Testicular pain may dissipate slowly after orgasm, or on its own once the individual is no longer aroused. Realizing that ejaculation is not a requirement for all sexual situations can help partners become more comfortable together and experience better sexual intimacy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From the [website](https://neilbaum.wordpress.com/2013/05/12/blue-balls-sex-and-painful-testicles/) of a Urologist named Dr. Neil Baum:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Blue Balls-Sex and Painful Testicles&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Blue balls are not just a figment of a male’s imagination or a lame excuse to try and get you in the sack. Though it doesn’t happen to all men, it is a very real condition that results from a prolonged state of sexual arousal. When a guy is physically turned on, blood flows to his penis, which is what gives him an erection, which is a good thing, and his testicles, causing them to swell, not such a good thing! If he doesn’t ejaculate, there is a buildup of pressure, and his supersensitive testicles start to hurt. The sensation can range from a mild ache to worse-than-getting-kicked-in-the-crotch pain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Bottom line: **Blue balls are not dangerous**, and a young man can resolve it. The easiest solution is for the man to masturbate as an orgasm and ejaculation will cause the congestion in the penis and scrotum to abate. Just as the erection will subside after an ejaculation, the congestion around the testicles will also subside and the pain will go away. If the young man has an aversion to masturbation, then just waiting it out is also a solution as the blood will eventually drain, and any discomfort will disappear on its own.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another entry from Dr. Baum:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Men who believe that they should ejaculate every time they have an erection *are likely to exert pressure on their partner to proceed with sex without taking her feelings into consideration***.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Some men find that masturbation is a viable solution and are realizing that ejaculation is not a requirement in every sexual situation. This attitude allows both men and their partners to relax more and to learn that pleasure and meaning can exist without having to reach ejaculation and orgasm during every sexual encounter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Are You Doing Something Wrong?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Absolutely not.  If your husband is anything like me, it takes a lot to cause blueballs.  If you're being candid with him and letting him know that you're not in the mood, he should stop doing the things that lead to blueballs.  In my own experience, it was much easier to get blueballs when I was a teenager ravaged by his own hormones.  Now that I'm an adult, it is much more difficult to get blueballs.  The last time it happened, I had been &quot;dry humping&quot; for an hour or more.  The point is this:  He doesn't just get blueballs at the drop of a hat.  He has to work at it for a significant amount of time before he's at risk of blueballs.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This being the case, and assuming that you are being open and honest about not wanting to have sex, the blame for his blueballs lies squarely on his own shoulders.  He did it to himself.  I don't want to make any wild assumptions, but it seems that if you're telling him that you aren't in the mood, and he is still managing to give himself blueballs, he is probably pushing way too hard, and not listening to what you're saying.  If a woman told me that she didn't want to have sex, I would accept it and move on.  I certainly wouldn't keep dry humping her, especially not for so long that I got blueballs.  You might want to tell your husband to pay more attention to what **you** want and don't want.  The fact that he &quot;feels guilty&quot; after the fact is no excuse, and it doesn't change the fact that he was ignoring your desires and needs.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wouldn't worry too much about your husband's suffering, because it is temporary and probably not as serious as menstrual pains, but especially because he should be able to control how worked up he lets himself become.  If you are being forthcoming about not being in the mood, and he still gets himself all hot and bothered, he has only himself to blame.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, you aren't to blame for your husband's apparent lack of self control, and in any case, there are no long term health effects related to frequent blueball episodes.  It's no more serious than any other situational pain not caused by an actual injury.  It is very uncomfortable, but not really harmful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Note:  I'm hesitant to say this, because as I have already said, under no circumstances should anyone ever try to coerce, cajole, or guilt trip someone into having sex against their will, and by the same token, *you aren't obligated to do anything to prevent your husband from getting himself so excited that he ends up with blueballs*.&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;However, I don't think it is going too far to say this:  **The most you can do is to make sure he knows when he isn't going to get any, so he doesn't get himself all riled up**.

It is frequently the case that some people who are embarrassed or intimidated by the idea of engaging in certain sexual acts find it easier to overcome their hesitation when they are in the heat of the moment, so to speak, and especially if they **receive** the sexual act before they have to perform it, rather than having to &quot;go first&quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

I am merely saying that if someone is reluctant to perform a sexual act because they are embarrassed or intimidated by the prospect, the embarrassment and intimidation may be lessened by having someone perform the same act first, thereby making it less of a big deal.  The same idea applies to the people hired by nightclubs to start dancing as soon as the club opens.  People are often reluctant to be the first person to do something that could be considered embarrassing, especially if they think they'll be the only person doing it;  this is why it is much harder to be the first person on the dance floor than it is to be the 40th person on the dance floor.&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Again, I've never used these, so I can't vouch for their effectiveness.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would recommend, as a previous answer has done, that you use a condom, preferably a thick one, if you are interested in lasting as long as possible.  The less you feel, the longer you will last.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other common recommendations include taking it slowly for as long as you can, and, when you feel like you're getting too close to the finish line, thinking about unsexy things - I've heard everything from baseball stats to remembering scenes from horror movies, and from bible stories to imagining your grandmother sitting on the toilet saying your name.

This is not dysfunctional or harmful in any way.  Neither are most other fetishes, like mild BDSM, clown fetishes, latex fetishes, and so on. As far as I know, if a fetish doesn't lead to problems in your day to day life, and if it doesn't cause injury or the risk of injury, psychologists don't consider it a sign of dysfunction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#When Does a Fetish Become a Problem?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a complicated issue, and to address it, we need to look at the diagnostic criteria psychologists and psychiatrists use.  These are contained in a book called the DSM, or the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychological Association*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychological Association?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I will refer to the definitions of paraphilias as described in the DSM here, and I will do so at considerable length. For those who don't know, the DSM is the book psychologists and psychiatrists use to diagnose mental illnesses.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The version of the DSM I own is the DSM-IV, or in other words, the fourth edition of the DSM.  The DSM-IV is now outdated, but only slightly, because the fifth edition, or DSM-V, was recently published.  Since I only have access to the DSM-IV, I will have to rely on it.  As I understand it, the portions of the DSM which we are interested in here have not been substantially revised in the fifth edition, so this shouldn't be a problem.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##How Does the DSM Work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, the DSM describes a given condition, then the criteria by which the condition is diagnosed, then provides the diagnostic codes, and in some cases, lists variations on the primary condition.  It also provides statistical data on each of the conditions described, such as how common the condition is, how many people with a given condition fall into different categories, and so on.  It does not explain how these conditions should be treated.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Very broadly, the diagnostic criteria include things like the duration of the condition, what effects the condition has on different aspects of the patient's daily life, and sometimes, a list of possible symptoms is provided.  Most of the time, and with most conditions, a formal diagnosis requires that the patient meet a certain number of criteria.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, a diagnosis of &quot;Major Depressive Episode&quot;, commonly referred to as a bout of depression, requires that the patient report at least five out of 9 possible symptoms, and that the symptoms persist for at least two weeks.  In addition, the diagnosis requires that the symptoms are not better explained by another diagnosis, that they are not the result of a medical condition or drug, and that they are not the result of reasonable mood changes related to normal upsetting events like bereavement at the loss of a loved one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that we know how the DSM is supposed to be used, we can turn to the subject at hand.  For the sake of brevity, I can't describe the diagnostic criteria for every sexual fetish treated as a disorder.  Therefore, I will provide a single example, discuss it at length, and try to summarize the rest of the information as best I can.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it makes sense to focus on the paraphilia&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; described as Sexual Masochism Disorder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What Does the DSM Say About Sexual Masochism Disorder?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The DSM lists [Sexual Masochism Disorder][1] as a mental illness, and has done so since the late 60's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From Wikipedia's [entry][1] on Sexual Masochism Disorder:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sexual masochism disorder is the condition of experiencing recurring and intense sexual arousal in response to enduring extreme pain, suffering, or humiliation.  It may occur either with or without asphyxiophilia, the experience of sexual arousal from restricted breathing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The World Health Organization broadly agrees with this assessment:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sadomasochism appears in the current version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization.  It refers to the “preference for sexual activity that involves bondage or the infliction of pain or humiliation” (p. 172), and divides sadomasochism into masochism and sadism according to whether the individual prefers to be the recipient or provider of it. The ICD-10 specifies that mild forms of sadomasochism “are commonly used to enhance otherwise normal sexual activity” (p. 172), and that the diagnosis would apply only if the behavior is preferred or required for sexual gratification. The condition is classified as one of the disorders of sexual preference, which includes the paraphilias (p. 170).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The relevant page of the DSM-IV, showing the description of the condition:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;And the diagnostic criteria for the condition:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is important to note that this does **not** mean that anyone who enjoys BDSM is dysfunctional, nor does it mean that there is anything wrong with enjoying BDSM.  The paraphilia only becomes a disorder if it meets the following criteria:  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;A.  Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving the act (real, not simulated) of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;B.  The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What Does the DSM Say About Other Paraphilias?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other sexual fetishes listed as psychological disorders within the category of paraphilias in the DSM are as follows&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Sexual Sadism (&quot;inflicting humiliation or suffering&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Transvestic Fetishism (&quot;cross dressing&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Voyeurism (&quot;observing sexual activity&quot;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Fetishism (&quot;use of nonliving objects&quot;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Pedophilia (&quot;focus on prepubescent children&quot;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Frotteurism (&quot;touching and rubbing against a nonconsenting person&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Exhibitionism (&quot;exposure of genitals&quot;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The criteria for diagnosing the paraphilias listed above are broadly similar to the criteria for diagnosing Sexual Masochism Disorder, although the terms of the criteria are obviously tailored to the specific behaviors, fantasies, and sexual urges associated with the paraphilia in question.  The duration criteria is always &quot;at least 6 months&quot;, and in every case, it is necessary for the fantasies, behaviors, or sexual urges to &quot;cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is worth noting that several of the paraphilias listed above are also crimes: Frotteurism is sexual assault;  Exhibitionism is sexual assault, albeit without direct contact in most cases;  Pedophilia is child molestation, another form of sexual assault; and in some cases, Voyeurism is considered stalking, invasion of privacy, peeping, illegal surveillance, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would imagine - and hope - that most people would agree that pedophilia, nonconsensual touching and rubbing, exposing your genitals to nonconsenting people, and spying on nonconsenting people for sexual kicks are not only dysfunctional behaviors, but also immoral and criminal activities.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Summary:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##In general, for a paraphilia to be considered a psychological disorder in the DSM, it must persist for at least 6 months, and it must &quot;cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot;.  It is also important to say that most fetishes are **not** considered to be indicative of dysfunction, and are certainly not considered to be actual disorders.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fetishes that don't involve physical injury or violence are largely considered harmless.  There is nothing wrong with being turned on by clowns, or feet, or people dressed in mascot costumes, or whatever else you like, as long as it doesn't result in any of the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Criminal activity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Serious bodily harm or emotional trauma.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Quite apart from the issue of psychological disorders, it is obviously morally unacceptable to involve the following in your sexual behaviors or activities:  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Unsuspecting or nonconsenting persons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Persons below the legal age of consent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Persons who are incapable (either permanently or temporarily) of giving their consent (e.g., intoxicated or unconscious people, etc.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The DSM defines paraphilia as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[R]ecurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors generally involving 1) Nonhuman objects, 2) the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one's partner, or 3) children or other nonconsenting persons, that occur over a period of at least 6 months (Criterion A).  For some individuals, paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli are obligatory for erotic arousal and are always included in sexual activity.  In other cases, the paraphiliac preferences occur only episodically (e.g., perhaps during periods of stress), whereas at other times the person is able to function sexually without paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli.  The behavior, sexual urges, or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion B).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The quotes in parentheses are the brief summary descriptions given in the DSM.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The more thorough description goes into more detail.  The paraphilia is specifically related to &quot;the act of observing an **unsuspecting** person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; There is an additional criterion for Fetishism:  &quot;The nonliving objects are not limited to articles of female clothing used in cross-dressing (as in Transvestic Fetishism) or devices designed for the purpose of tactile genital stimulation (e.g., a vibrator). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;In the case of Pedophilia too, there is an additional criterion:  the patient must be at least 16 years old, and at least 6 years older than the child or children whom the patient is fantasizing about, having sexual urges towards, or engaging in sexual behaviors.  It also requires that the diagnosing physician record which gender(s) the patient is attracted to; whether the attraction is limited to incest;  and whether the patient is exclusively attracted to children, or also attracted to adults.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;The criteria for Exhibitionism specify that the person to whom the patient exposes his or her genitals must be &quot;an unsuspecting stranger&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_masochism_disorder&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/6YSHi.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/mdNYh.jpg" />

The DSM-IV is now outdated, but only slightly, because the fifth edition, or DSM-V, was recently published.  Since I only have access to the DSM-IV, I will have to rely on it.  As I understand it, the portions of the DSM which we are interested in here have not been substantially revised in the fifth edition, so this shouldn't be a problem.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##How Does the DSM Work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, the DSM describes a given condition, then the criteria by which the condition is diagnosed, then provides the diagnostic codes, and in some cases, lists variations on the primary condition.  It also provides statistical data on each of the conditions described, such as how common the condition is, how many people with a given condition fall into different categories, and so on.  It does not explain how these conditions should be treated.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Very broadly, the diagnostic criteria include things like the duration of the condition, what effects the condition has on different aspects of the patient's daily life, and sometimes, a list of possible symptoms is provided.  Most of the time, and with most conditions, a formal diagnosis requires that the patient meet a certain number of criteria.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, a diagnosis of &quot;Major Depressive Episode&quot;, commonly referred to as a bout of depression, requires that the patient report at least five out of 9 possible symptoms, and that the symptoms persist for at least two weeks.  In addition, the diagnosis requires that the symptoms are not better explained by another diagnosis, that they are not the result of a medical condition or drug, and that they are not the result of reasonable mood changes related to normal upsetting events like bereavement at the loss of a loved one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that we know how the DSM is supposed to be used, we can turn to the subject at hand.  For the sake of brevity, I can't describe the diagnostic criteria for every sexual fetish treated as a disorder.  Therefore, I will provide a single example, discuss it at length, and try to summarize the rest of the information as best I can.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it makes sense to focus on the paraphilia&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; described as Sexual Masochism Disorder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What Does the DSM Say About Sexual Masochism Disorder?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The DSM lists [Sexual Masochism Disorder][1] as a mental illness, and has done so since the late 60's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From Wikipedia's [entry][1] on Sexual Masochism Disorder:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sexual masochism disorder is the condition of experiencing recurring and intense sexual arousal in response to enduring extreme pain, suffering, or humiliation.  It may occur either with or without asphyxiophilia, the experience of sexual arousal from restricted breathing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The World Health Organization broadly agrees with this assessment:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sadomasochism appears in the current version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization.  It refers to the “preference for sexual activity that involves bondage or the infliction of pain or humiliation” (p. 172), and divides sadomasochism into masochism and sadism according to whether the individual prefers to be the recipient or provider of it. The ICD-10 specifies that mild forms of sadomasochism “are commonly used to enhance otherwise normal sexual activity” (p. 172), and that the diagnosis would apply only if the behavior is preferred or required for sexual gratification. The condition is classified as one of the disorders of sexual preference, which includes the paraphilias (p. 170).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The relevant page of the DSM-IV, showing the description of the condition:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;And the diagnostic criteria for the condition:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is important to note that this does **not** mean that anyone who enjoys BDSM is dysfunctional, nor does it mean that there is anything wrong with enjoying BDSM.  The paraphilia only becomes a disorder if it meets the following criteria:  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;A.  Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving the act (real, not simulated) of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;B.  The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What Does the DSM Say About Other Paraphilias?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other sexual fetishes listed as psychological disorders within the category of paraphilias in the DSM are as follows&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Sexual Sadism (&quot;inflicting humiliation or suffering&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Transvestic Fetishism (&quot;cross dressing&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Voyeurism (&quot;observing sexual activity&quot;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Fetishism (&quot;use of nonliving objects&quot;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Pedophilia (&quot;focus on prepubescent children&quot;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Frotteurism (&quot;touching and rubbing against a nonconsenting person&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Exhibitionism (&quot;exposure of genitals&quot;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The criteria for diagnosing the paraphilias listed above are broadly similar to the criteria for diagnosing Sexual Masochism Disorder, although the terms of the criteria are obviously tailored to the specific behaviors, fantasies, and sexual urges associated with the paraphilia in question.  The duration criteria is always &quot;at least 6 months&quot;, and in every case, it is necessary for the fantasies, behaviors, or sexual urges to &quot;cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot;.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Summary:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##In general, for a paraphilia to be considered a psychological disorder in the DSM, it must persist for at least 6 months, and it must &quot;cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot;.  It is also important to say that most fetishes are **not** considered to be indicative of dysfunction, and are certainly not considered to be actual disorders.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fetishes that don't involve physical injury or violence are largely considered harmless.  There is nothing wrong with being turned on by clowns, or feet, or people dressed in mascot costumes, or whatever else you like, as long as it doesn't result in any of the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Criminal activity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Serious bodily harm or emotional trauma.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Quite apart from the issue of psychological disorders, it is obviously morally unacceptable to involve the following in your sexual behaviors or activities:  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Unsuspecting or nonconsenting persons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Persons below the legal age of consent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Persons who are incapable (either permanently or temporarily) of giving their consent (e.g., intoxicated or unconscious people, etc.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The DSM defines paraphilia as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[R]ecurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors generally involving 1) Nonhuman objects, 2) the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one's partner, or 3) children or other nonconsenting persons, that occur over a period of at least 6 months (Criterion A).  For some individuals, paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli are obligatory for erotic arousal and are always included in sexual activity.  In other cases, the paraphiliac preferences occur only episodically (e.g., perhaps during periods of stress), whereas at other times the person is able to function sexually without paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli.  The behavior, sexual urges, or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion B).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The quotes in parentheses are the brief summary descriptions given in the DSM.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The more thorough description goes into more detail.  The paraphilia is specifically related to &quot;the act of observing an **unsuspecting** person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; There is an additional criterion for Fetishism:  &quot;The nonliving objects are not limited to articles of female clothing used in cross-dressing (as in Transvestic Fetishism) or devices designed for the purpose of tactile genital stimulation (e.g., a vibrator). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;In the case of Pedophilia too, there is an additional criterion:  the patient must be at least 16 years old, and at least 6 years older than the child or children whom the patient is fantasizing about, having sexual urges towards, or engaging in sexual behaviors.  It also requires that the diagnosing physician record which gender(s) the patient is attracted to; whether the attraction is limited to incest;  and whether the patient is exclusively attracted to children, or also attracted to adults.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;The criteria for Exhibitionism specify that the person to whom the patient exposes his or her genitals must be &quot;an unsuspecting stranger&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_masochism_disorder&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/6YSHi.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/mdNYh.jpg" />

The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;Differential Diagnosis&quot; part of the chapter on paraphilias describes what is meant by criterion B, and since criterion B is part of the diagnosis of every single paraphilia, understanding this is very important for the purposes of this question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;#Fantasies, behaviors, or objects are paraphiliac only when they lead to clinically significant distress or impairment (e.g., are obligatory, result in sexual dysfunction, require participation of nonconsenting individuals, lead to legal complications, interfere with social relationships).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What Other Fetishes are Listed as Paraphilias in the DSM?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other sexual fetishes listed as psychological disorders within the category of paraphilias in the DSM are as follows&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Sexual Sadism (&quot;inflicting humiliation or suffering&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Transvestic Fetishism (&quot;cross dressing&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Voyeurism (&quot;observing sexual activity&quot;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Fetishism (&quot;use of nonliving objects&quot;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Pedophilia (&quot;focus on prepubescent children&quot;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Frotteurism (&quot;touching and rubbing against a nonconsenting person&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Exhibitionism (&quot;exposure of genitals&quot;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The criteria for diagnosing the paraphilias listed above are broadly similar to the criteria for diagnosing Sexual Masochism Disorder, although the terms of the criteria are obviously tailored to the specific behaviors, fantasies, and sexual urges associated with the paraphilia in question.

As the previous answer said, there hasn't been much research on the subject.  The DSM confirms this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Although paraphilias are rarely diagnosed in general clinical facilities, the large commercial market in paraphiliac pornography and paraphernalia suggests that its prevalence in the community is likely to be much higher.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it seems that fetishes often begin early in life:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Certain of the fantasies and behaviors associated with paraphilias may begin in childhood or early adolescence but become better defined and elaborated during adolescence and early adulthood.  Elaboration and revision of paraphiliac fantasies may continue over the lifetime of the individual...  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The disorders tend to be chronic and lifelong, but both the fantasies and the behaviors often diminish with advancing age in adults.  The behaviors may increase in response to psychosocial stressors, in relation to other mental disorders, or with increased opportunity to engage in the paraphilia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Summary:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##In general, for a paraphilia to be considered a psychological disorder in the DSM, it must persist for at least 6 months, and it must &quot;cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot;.

As I understand it, the portions of the DSM which we are interested in here have not been substantially revised in the fifth edition, so this shouldn't be a problem.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Why Should We Pay Attention to the DSM?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because &quot;dysfunction&quot; and &quot;disorder&quot; are technical terms, and they describe specific medical conditions.  If you wanted to know the answer to a question like &quot;What is cancer?&quot;, you would ask a doctor or other medical professional.  If you wanted to know what a carburetor is, you would ask a mechanic.  We're talking about psychological disorders, so we need to ask what psychologists and psychiatrists say about it.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The book psychologists and psychiatrists use to identify and diagnose mental illnesses is the DSM.  Therefore, there is no better place to turn for information about this subject than the DSM.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##How Does the DSM Work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, the DSM describes a given condition, then the criteria by which the condition is diagnosed, then provides the diagnostic codes, and in some cases, lists variations on the primary condition.

Fantasies, behaviors, or objects are paraphiliac only when they lead to clinically significant distress or impairment (e.g., are obligatory, result in sexual dysfunction, require participation of nonconsenting individuals, lead to legal complications, interfere with social relationships).   &#xD;&#xA;[emphasis in the original text]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What Other Fetishes are Listed as Paraphilias in the DSM?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other sexual fetishes listed as psychological disorders within the category of paraphilias in the DSM are as follows&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Sexual Sadism (&quot;inflicting humiliation or suffering&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Transvestic Fetishism (&quot;cross dressing&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Voyeurism (&quot;observing sexual activity&quot;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Fetishism (&quot;use of nonliving objects&quot;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Pedophilia (&quot;focus on prepubescent children&quot;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Frotteurism (&quot;touching and rubbing against a nonconsenting person&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Exhibitionism (&quot;exposure of genitals&quot;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The criteria for diagnosing the paraphilias listed above are broadly similar to the criteria for diagnosing Sexual Masochism Disorder, although the terms of the criteria are obviously tailored to the specific behaviors, fantasies, and sexual urges associated with the paraphilia in question.  The duration criteria is always &quot;at least 6 months&quot;, and in every case, it is necessary for the fantasies, behaviors, or sexual urges to &quot;cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot;.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#How Do Fetishes Start?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We don't really know.  As the previous answer said, there hasn't been much research on the subject.  The DSM confirms this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Although paraphilias are rarely diagnosed in general clinical facilities, the large commercial market in paraphiliac pornography and paraphernalia suggests that its prevalence in the community is likely to be much higher.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it seems that paraphiliac fetishes often begin early in life:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Certain of the fantasies and behaviors associated with paraphilias may begin in childhood or early adolescence but become better defined and elaborated during adolescence and early adulthood.  Elaboration and revision of paraphiliac fantasies may continue over the lifetime of the individual...  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The disorders tend to be chronic and lifelong, but both the fantasies and the behaviors often diminish with advancing age in adults.  The behaviors may increase in response to psychosocial stressors, in relation to other mental disorders, or with increased opportunity to engage in the paraphilia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What Makes Paraphiliac (i.e., Dysfunctional) Fetishes Different From Other Fetishes?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most fetishes are harmless.  Paraphiliac fetishes are not.  The *Diagnostic Features* section of the chapter on paraphilias sums up the difference very well.  I have added line breaks and emphasis for the sake of clarity and readability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Paraphiliac imagery may be acted out with a *nonconsenting* partner in a way that may be injurious to the partner** (as in Sexual Sadism or Pedophilia). **The individual may be subject to arrest and incarceration**.  Sexual offenses against children constitute a significant proportion of all reported criminal sex acts, and individuals with Exhibitionism, Pedophilia, and Voyeurism make up the majority of apprehended sex offenders.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**In some situations, acting out the paraphiliac imagery may lead to self-injury** (as in Sexual Masochism).  **Social and sexual relationships may suffer** if others find the unusual sexual behavior shameful or repugnant or if the individual's sexual partner refuses to cooperate in the unusual sexual preferences. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In some instances, the unusual behavior (e.g., exhibitionist acts or the collection of fetish objects) may become the major sexual activity in the individual's life.  **These individuals are rarely self-reported and usually come to the attention of mental health professionals only when their behavior has brought them into conflict with sexual partners or society.**  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Summary:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##In general, for a paraphilia to be considered a psychological disorder,  it must persist for at least 6 months, and it must &quot;cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot;.  It is also important to say that most fetishes are **not** considered to be indicative of dysfunction, and are certainly not considered to be actual disorders.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fetishes that don't involve physical injury, nonconsenting persons, criminal activity, or potentially injurious amounts of violence are largely considered harmless.  There is nothing wrong with being turned on by clowns, or feet, or people dressed in mascot costumes, or whatever else you like, as long as it doesn't result in any of the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Sexual dysfunction. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Criminal activity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Serious bodily harm or emotional trauma.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Interference with social relationships.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  The involvement of nonconsenting people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The DSM defines paraphilia as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[R]ecurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors generally involving 1) Nonhuman objects, 2) the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one's partner, or 3) children or other nonconsenting persons, that occur over a period of at least 6 months (Criterion A).  For some individuals, paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli are obligatory for erotic arousal and are always included in sexual activity.  In other cases, the paraphiliac preferences occur only episodically (e.g., perhaps during periods of stress), whereas at other times the person is able to function sexually without paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli.  The behavior, sexual urges, or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion B).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The quotes in parentheses are the brief summary descriptions given in the DSM.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The more thorough description goes into more detail.  The paraphilia is specifically related to &quot;the act of observing an **unsuspecting** person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; There is an additional criterion for Fetishism:  &quot;The nonliving objects are not limited to articles of female clothing used in cross-dressing (as in Transvestic Fetishism) or devices designed for the purpose of tactile genital stimulation (e.g., a vibrator). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;In the case of Pedophilia too, there is an additional criterion:  the patient must be at least 16 years old, and at least 6 years older than the child or children whom the patient is fantasizing about, having sexual urges towards, or engaging in sexual behaviors.  It also requires that the diagnosing physician record which gender(s) the patient is attracted to; whether the attraction is limited to incest;  and whether the patient is exclusively attracted to children, or also attracted to adults.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;The criteria for Exhibitionism specify that the person to whom the patient exposes his or her genitals must be &quot;an unsuspecting stranger&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_masochism_disorder&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/6YSHi.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/mdNYh.jpg" />

That's what we're really interested in here:  when is a fetish *defined* as a paraphiliac disorder?**   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychological Association?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my answer, I will refer to the definitions of paraphilias as described in the DSM, and I will do so at considerable length. For those who don't know, the DSM is the book psychologists and psychiatrists use to diagnose mental illnesses.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The version of the DSM I own is the DSM-IV, or in other words, the fourth edition of the DSM.  The DSM-IV is now outdated, but only slightly, because the fifth edition, or DSM-V, was recently published.  Since I only have access to the DSM-IV, I will have to rely on it.  As I understand it, the portions of the DSM which we are interested in here have not been substantially revised in the fifth edition, so this shouldn't be a problem.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Why Should We Pay Attention to the DSM?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because &quot;dysfunction&quot; and &quot;disorder&quot; are technical terms, and they describe specific medical conditions.  If you wanted to know the answer to a question like &quot;What is cancer?&quot;, you would ask a doctor or other medical professional.  If you wanted to know what a carburetor is, you would ask a mechanic.  We're talking about psychological disorders, so we need to ask what psychologists and psychiatrists say about it.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The book psychologists and psychiatrists use to identify and diagnose mental illnesses is the DSM.  Therefore, there is no better place to turn for information about this subject than the DSM.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##How Does the DSM Work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, the DSM describes a given condition, then the criteria by which the condition is diagnosed, then provides the diagnostic codes, and in some cases, lists variations on the primary condition.  It also provides statistical data on each of the conditions described, such as how common the condition is, how many people with a given condition fall into different categories, and so on.  It does not explain how these conditions should be treated.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Very broadly, the diagnostic criteria include things like the duration of the condition, what effects the condition has on different aspects of the patient's daily life, and sometimes, a list of possible symptoms is provided.  Most of the time, and with most conditions, a formal diagnosis requires that the patient meet a certain number of criteria.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, a diagnosis of &quot;Major Depressive Episode&quot;, commonly referred to as a bout of depression, requires that the patient report at least five out of 9 possible symptoms, and that the symptoms persist for at least two weeks.  In addition, the diagnosis requires that the symptoms are not better explained by another diagnosis, that they are not the result of a medical condition or drug, and that they are not the result of reasonable mood changes related to normal upsetting events like bereavement at the loss of a loved one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that we know how the DSM is supposed to be used, we can turn to the subject at hand.  For the sake of brevity, I can't describe the diagnostic criteria for every sexual fetish treated as a disorder.  Therefore, I will provide a single example, discuss it at length, and try to summarize the rest of the information as best I can.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it makes sense to focus on the paraphilia&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; described as Sexual Masochism Disorder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What Does the DSM Say About Sexual Masochism Disorder?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The DSM lists [Sexual Masochism Disorder][1] as a mental illness, and has done so since the late 60's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From Wikipedia's [entry][1] on Sexual Masochism Disorder:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sexual masochism disorder is the condition of experiencing recurring and intense sexual arousal in response to enduring extreme pain, suffering, or humiliation.  It may occur either with or without asphyxiophilia, the experience of sexual arousal from restricted breathing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The World Health Organization broadly agrees with this assessment:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sadomasochism appears in the current version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization.  It refers to the “preference for sexual activity that involves bondage or the infliction of pain or humiliation” (p. 172), and divides sadomasochism into masochism and sadism according to whether the individual prefers to be the recipient or provider of it. The ICD-10 specifies that mild forms of sadomasochism “are commonly used to enhance otherwise normal sexual activity” (p. 172), and that the diagnosis would apply only if the behavior is preferred or required for sexual gratification. The condition is classified as one of the disorders of sexual preference, which includes the paraphilias (p. 170).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The relevant page of the DSM-IV, showing the description of the condition:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;###It is important to note that this does *not* mean that anyone who enjoys BDSM is dysfunctional, nor does it mean that there is anything wrong with enjoying BDSM.  The paraphilia only becomes a disorder if it meets the following criteria: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;A.  Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving the act (real, not simulated) of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;B.  The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;Differential Diagnosis&quot; part of the chapter on paraphilias describes what is meant by criterion B, **and since criterion B is part of the diagnosis of *every single paraphiliac disorder*, understanding this is very important for the purposes of this question**:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;###A paraphilia must be distinguished from the *nonpathological use of sexual fantasies, behaviors, or objects as a stimulus for sexual excitement* in individuals without a paraphilia.

Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving the act (real, not simulated) of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;B.  The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;Differential Diagnosis&quot; part of the chapter on paraphilias describes what is meant by criterion B, **and since criterion B is part of the diagnosis of *every single paraphiliac disorder*, understanding this is very important for the purposes of this question**:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;A paraphilia must be distinguished from the **nonpathological use of sexual fantasies, behaviors, or objects as a stimulus for sexual excitement** in individuals without a paraphilia.  Fantasies, behaviors, or objects are paraphiliac only when they lead to clinically significant distress or impairment (e.g., are obligatory, result in sexual dysfunction, require participation of nonconsenting individuals, lead to legal complications, interfere with social relationships).   &#xD;&#xA;[emphasis in the original text]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What Other Fetishes are Listed as Paraphilias in the DSM?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other sexual fetishes listed as psychological disorders within the category of paraphilias in the DSM are as follows&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Sexual Sadism (&quot;inflicting humiliation or suffering&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Transvestic Fetishism (&quot;cross dressing&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Voyeurism (&quot;observing sexual activity&quot;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Fetishism (&quot;use of nonliving objects&quot;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Pedophilia (&quot;focus on prepubescent children&quot;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Frotteurism (&quot;touching and rubbing against a nonconsenting person&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Exhibitionism (&quot;exposure of genitals&quot;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified (...&quot;Paraphilias that do not meet the criteria for any of the specific categories.

Elaboration and revision of paraphiliac fantasies may continue over the lifetime of the individual...  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The disorders tend to be chronic and lifelong, but both the fantasies and the behaviors often diminish with advancing age in adults.  The behaviors may increase in response to psychosocial stressors, in relation to other mental disorders, or with increased opportunity to engage in the paraphilia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What Makes Paraphiliac (i.e., Dysfunctional) Fetishes Different From Other Fetishes?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most fetishes are harmless.

It is also important to say that most fetishes are **not** considered to be indicative of dysfunction, and are certainly not considered to be actual disorders.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fetishes that don't involve physical injury, nonconsenting persons, criminal activity, or potentially injurious amounts of violence are largely considered harmless.

For some individuals, paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli are obligatory for erotic arousal and are always included in sexual activity.  In other cases, the paraphiliac preferences occur only episodically (e.g., perhaps during periods of stress), whereas at other times the person is able to function sexually without paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli.  The behavior, sexual urges, or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion B).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The quotes in parentheses are the brief summary descriptions given in the DSM.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The more thorough description goes into more detail.

It also requires that the diagnosing physician record which gender(s) the patient is attracted to; whether the attraction is limited to incest;  and whether the patient is exclusively attracted to children, or also attracted to adults.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;The criteria for Exhibitionism specify that the person to whom the patient exposes his or her genitals must be &quot;an unsuspecting stranger&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_masochism_disorder&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/6YSHi.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/mdNYh.jpg" />

That's what we're really interested in here:  when is a fetish *defined* as a paraphiliac disorder?**   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#What is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychological Association?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my answer, I will refer to the definitions of paraphilias as described in the DSM, and I will do so at considerable length. For those who don't know, the DSM is the book psychologists and psychiatrists use to diagnose mental illnesses.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The version of the DSM I own is the DSM-IV, or in other words, the fourth edition of the DSM.  The DSM-IV is now outdated, but only slightly, because the fifth edition, or DSM-V, was recently published.  Since I only have access to the DSM-IV, I will have to rely on it.  As I understand it, the portions of the DSM which we are interested in here have not been substantially revised in the fifth edition, so this shouldn't be a problem.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Why Should We Pay Attention to the DSM?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because &quot;dysfunction&quot; and &quot;disorder&quot; are technical terms, and they describe specific medical conditions.  If you wanted to know the answer to a question like &quot;What is cancer?&quot;, you would ask a doctor or other medical professional.  If you wanted to know what a carburetor is, you would ask a mechanic.  We're talking about psychological disorders, so we need to ask what psychologists and psychiatrists say about it.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The book psychologists and psychiatrists use to identify and diagnose mental illnesses is the DSM.  Therefore, there is no better place to turn for information about this subject than the DSM.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#How Does the DSM Work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, the DSM describes a given condition, then the criteria by which the condition is diagnosed, then provides the diagnostic codes, and in some cases, lists variations on the primary condition.  It also provides statistical data on each of the conditions described, such as how common the condition is, how many people with a given condition fall into different categories, and so on.  It does not explain how these conditions should be treated.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Very broadly, the diagnostic criteria include things like the duration of the condition, what effects the condition has on different aspects of the patient's daily life, and sometimes, a list of possible symptoms is provided.  Most of the time, and with most conditions, a formal diagnosis requires that the patient meet a certain number of criteria.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, a diagnosis of &quot;Major Depressive Episode&quot;, commonly referred to as a bout of depression, requires that the patient report at least five out of 9 possible symptoms, and that the symptoms persist for at least two weeks.  In addition, the diagnosis requires that the symptoms are not better explained by another diagnosis, that they are not the result of a medical condition or drug, and that they are not the result of reasonable mood changes related to normal upsetting events like bereavement at the loss of a loved one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that we know how the DSM is supposed to be used, we can turn to the subject at hand.  For the sake of brevity, I can't describe the diagnostic criteria for every sexual fetish treated as a disorder.  Therefore, I will provide a single example, discuss it at length, and try to summarize the rest of the information as best I can.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it makes sense to focus on the paraphilia&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; described as Sexual Masochism Disorder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#What Does the DSM Say About Sexual Masochism Disorder?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The DSM lists [Sexual Masochism Disorder][1] as a mental illness, and has done so since the late 60's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From Wikipedia's [entry][1] on Sexual Masochism Disorder:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sexual masochism disorder is the condition of experiencing recurring and intense sexual arousal in response to enduring extreme pain, suffering, or humiliation.  It may occur either with or without asphyxiophilia, the experience of sexual arousal from restricted breathing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The World Health Organization broadly agrees with this assessment:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sadomasochism appears in the current version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization.  It refers to the “preference for sexual activity that involves bondage or the infliction of pain or humiliation” (p. 172), and divides sadomasochism into masochism and sadism according to whether the individual prefers to be the recipient or provider of it. The ICD-10 specifies that mild forms of sadomasochism “are commonly used to enhance otherwise normal sexual activity” (p. 172), and that the diagnosis would apply only if the behavior is preferred or required for sexual gratification. The condition is classified as one of the disorders of sexual preference, which includes the paraphilias (p. 170).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The relevant page of the DSM-IV, showing the description of the condition:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;###It is important to note that this does *not* mean that anyone who enjoys BDSM is dysfunctional, nor does it mean that there is anything wrong with enjoying BDSM.

The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;Differential Diagnosis&quot; part of the chapter on paraphilias describes what is meant by criterion B, **and since criterion B is part of the diagnosis of *every single paraphiliac disorder*, understanding this is very important for the purposes of this question**:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;A paraphilia must be distinguished from the **nonpathological use of sexual fantasies, behaviors, or objects as a stimulus for sexual excitement** in individuals without a paraphilia.

Most of the time, and with most conditions, a formal diagnosis requires that the patient meet a certain number of criteria.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, a diagnosis of &quot;Major Depressive Episode&quot;, commonly referred to as a bout of depression, requires that the patient report at least five out of 9 possible symptoms, and that the symptoms persist for at least two weeks.  In addition, the diagnosis requires that the symptoms are not better explained by another diagnosis, that they are not the result of a medical condition or drug, and that they are not the result of reasonable mood changes related to normal upsetting events like bereavement at the loss of a loved one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that we know how the DSM is supposed to be used, we can turn to the subject at hand.  For the sake of brevity, I can't describe the diagnostic criteria for every sexual fetish treated as a disorder.  Therefore, I will provide a single example, discuss it at length, and try to summarize the rest of the information as best I can.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it makes sense to focus on the paraphilia&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; described as Sexual Masochism Disorder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#What Does the DSM Say About Sexual Masochism Disorder?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The DSM lists [Sexual Masochism Disorder][1] as a mental illness, and has done so since the late 60's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From Wikipedia's [entry][1] on Sexual Masochism Disorder:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sexual masochism disorder is the condition of experiencing recurring and intense sexual arousal in response to enduring extreme pain, suffering, or humiliation.  It may occur either with or without asphyxiophilia, the experience of sexual arousal from restricted breathing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The World Health Organization broadly agrees with this assessment:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sadomasochism appears in the current version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization.  It refers to the “preference for sexual activity that involves bondage or the infliction of pain or humiliation” (p. 172), and divides sadomasochism into masochism and sadism according to whether the individual prefers to be the recipient or provider of it. The ICD-10 specifies that mild forms of sadomasochism “are commonly used to enhance otherwise normal sexual activity” (p. 172), and that the diagnosis would apply only if the behavior is preferred or required for sexual gratification. The condition is classified as one of the disorders of sexual preference, which includes the paraphilias (p. 170).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The relevant page of the DSM-IV, showing the description of the condition:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;###It is important to note that this does *not* mean that anyone who enjoys BDSM is dysfunctional, nor does it mean that there is anything wrong with enjoying BDSM.

Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving the act (real, not simulated) of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;B.  The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;Differential Diagnosis&quot; part of the chapter on paraphilias describes what is meant by criterion B, **and since criterion B is part of the diagnosis of *every single paraphiliac disorder*, understanding this is very important for the purposes of this question**:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;A paraphilia must be distinguished from the **nonpathological use of sexual fantasies, behaviors, or objects as a stimulus for sexual excitement** in individuals without a paraphilia.  Fantasies, behaviors, or objects are paraphiliac only when they lead to clinically significant distress or impairment (e.g., are obligatory, result in sexual dysfunction, require participation of nonconsenting individuals, lead to legal complications, interfere with social relationships).   &#xD;&#xA;[emphasis in the original text]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#What Other Fetishes are Listed as Paraphilias in the DSM?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other sexual fetishes listed as psychological disorders within the category of paraphilias in the DSM are as follows&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Sexual Sadism (&quot;inflicting humiliation or suffering&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Transvestic Fetishism (&quot;cross dressing&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Voyeurism (&quot;observing sexual activity&quot;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Fetishism (&quot;use of nonliving objects&quot;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Pedophilia (&quot;focus on prepubescent children&quot;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Frotteurism (&quot;touching and rubbing against a nonconsenting person&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Exhibitionism (&quot;exposure of genitals&quot;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified (...&quot;Paraphilias that do not meet the criteria for any of the specific categories.

Elaboration and revision of paraphiliac fantasies may continue over the lifetime of the individual...  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The disorders tend to be chronic and lifelong, but both the fantasies and the behaviors often diminish with advancing age in adults.  The behaviors may increase in response to psychosocial stressors, in relation to other mental disorders, or with increased opportunity to engage in the paraphilia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#What Makes Paraphiliac (i.e., Dysfunctional) Fetishes Different From Other Fetishes?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most fetishes are harmless.

It is also important to say that the overwhelming majority of fetishes are **not** considered to be indicative of dysfunction, and are certainly not considered to be actual disorders.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Footnotes*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The DSM defines paraphilia as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[R]ecurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors generally involving 1) Nonhuman objects, 2) the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one's partner, or 3) children or other nonconsenting persons, that occur over a period of at least 6 months (Criterion A).  For some individuals, paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli are obligatory for erotic arousal and are always included in sexual activity.  In other cases, the paraphiliac preferences occur only episodically (e.g., perhaps during periods of stress), whereas at other times the person is able to function sexually without paraphiliac fantasies or stimuli.

There is nothing wrong with being turned on by clowns, or feet, or people dressed in mascot costumes, or reasonable amounts of BDSM, or whatever else you like, as long as it doesn't result in or involve any of the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Sexual dysfunction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Criminal activity (obviously, this doesn't apply to LGBTQ people who happen to live in an area where homosexuality is criminalized - it is limited to things like pedophilia, nonconsensual exhibitionism, frotteurism, and voyeurism, etc.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Serious bodily harm or emotional trauma.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Interference with social relationships.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  The involvement of nonconsenting people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#When Does a Fetish Become a Problem?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a complicated issue, and to address it, we need to look at the diagnostic criteria psychologists and psychiatrists use.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These definitions, diagnostic criteria, and descriptions are contained in a book called the DSM, or the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychological Association*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**If you're not comfortable with the clinical terminology, you can ignore the words &quot;diagnostic criteria&quot; and imagine that it says &quot;definition&quot;.   That's what we're really interested in here:  when is a fetish *defined* as a paraphiliac disorder?**   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#What is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychological Association?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my answer, I will refer to the definitions of paraphilias as described in the DSM, and I will do so at considerable length. For those who don't know, the DSM is the book psychologists and psychiatrists use to diagnose mental illnesses.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The version of the DSM I own is the DSM-IV, or in other words, the fourth edition of the DSM.  The DSM-IV is now outdated, but only slightly, because the fifth edition, or DSM-V, was recently published.  Since I only have access to the DSM-IV, I will have to rely on it.  As I understand it, the portions of the DSM which we are interested in here have not been substantially revised in the fifth edition, so this shouldn't be a problem.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;#The Complete Answer:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Why Should We Pay Attention to the DSM?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because &quot;dysfunction&quot; and &quot;disorder&quot; are technical terms, and they describe specific medical conditions.  If you wanted to know the answer to a question like &quot;What is cancer?&quot;, you would ask a doctor or other medical professional.  If you wanted to know what a carburetor is, you would ask a mechanic.  We're talking about psychological disorders, so we need to ask what psychologists and psychiatrists say about it.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The book psychologists and psychiatrists use to identify and diagnose mental illnesses is the DSM.  Therefore, there is no better place to turn for information about this subject than the DSM.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##How Does the DSM Work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, the DSM describes a given condition, then the criteria by which the condition is diagnosed, then provides the diagnostic codes, and in some cases, lists variations on the primary condition.  It also provides statistical data on each of the conditions described, such as how common the condition is, how many people with a given condition fall into different categories, and so on.  It does not explain how these conditions should be treated.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Very broadly, the diagnostic criteria include things like the duration of the condition, what effects the condition has on different aspects of the patient's daily life, and sometimes, a list of possible symptoms is provided.  Most of the time, and with most conditions, a formal diagnosis requires that the patient meet a certain number of criteria.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, a diagnosis of &quot;Major Depressive Episode&quot;, commonly referred to as a bout of depression, requires that the patient report at least five out of 9 possible symptoms, and that the symptoms persist for at least two weeks.  In addition, the diagnosis requires that the symptoms are not better explained by another diagnosis, that they are not the result of a medical condition or drug, and that they are not the result of reasonable mood changes related to normal upsetting events like bereavement at the loss of a loved one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that we know how the DSM is supposed to be used, we can turn to the subject at hand.  For the sake of brevity, I can't describe the diagnostic criteria for every sexual fetish treated as a disorder.  Therefore, I will provide a single example, discuss it at length, and try to summarize the rest of the information as best I can.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it makes sense to focus on the paraphilia&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; described as Sexual Masochism Disorder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##What Does the DSM Say About Sexual Masochism Disorder?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The DSM lists [Sexual Masochism Disorder][1] as a mental illness, and has done so since the late 60's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From Wikipedia's [entry][1] on Sexual Masochism Disorder:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Sexual masochism disorder is the condition of experiencing recurring and intense sexual arousal in response to enduring extreme pain, suffering, or humiliation.

And during sleep even toddlers get nightly erections (“nocturnal penile tumescence”). So it is absolute normal, that boys get also erections when they are awake. The body of every healthy child-boy is capable of producing an erection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When not during the period of sleep, this very often goes together with manual stimulation, from simply touching up to fully masturbation, even in very young years. I remember that I masturbated when I was 5, probably I did it before, but I have no memories to those early days. And when I was 7, I learned from my classmates, that they did the same, and some of them also had those 90°-erections. Many years ago I also talked with two nurses (teachers of 3 to 6 year old kids) (independently from each other), who also said, that they often have seen masturbation even at 3 year old boys and girls, and both women said, that this is not rare.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I also have heard of many adult men who pretend to never have had erections as a prepubescent boy.

So in those times it was not just only normal to be gay, gay men even was seen as some kind of “better” or “nobler” men. No wonder, that in those times the percentage of men claiming to be gay, was very high.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But in mediaeval times, or in Nazi-Germany, homosexuals have been killed for being gay or lesbian. So almost nobody dared to confess his/her homosexuality.

He saw no evidence for the phenomenon, but plenty of random overlaps that could be seen as synchrony if viewed through a shorter time window.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it appears to be mostly coincidence and experimental deficiency(after all, there are only roughly four weeks in a month, so people are bound to overlap, especially if their menstrual cycle is irregular). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, here's an interesting study: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; McClintock points to her 1998 Nature paper, which found that women exposed to cotton pads soaked with underarm secretions collected from donors undergoing the first and second (follicular and luteal) phases of their cycles resulted in significantly altered menstrual cycle lengths in the test women. The results, however, rested on a knife-edge of statistical significance, Schank says, and could have been due to chance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; But a team of Japanese researchers at Yokohama City University, led by Kazuyuki Shinohara, also found in a series of papers that donor women undergoing these two phases of the menstrual cycle release compounds that when inhaled by other women can significantly impact the frequency in the latter of pulses of luteinizing hormone (LH), which helps control the timing of ovulation and cycle length.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So there's no hard evidence that periods syncronize under normal living circumstances.

However, I can definitely say that if you shave your pubes, you will have to make it a habit to shave them quite regularly as even after minor growth, the hair would start pinching you in all the wrong places (Do not even think of shaving the hair around your anus for this very reason). I would like to add that this is particularly true for men from the Indian subcontinent. Men from other parts of the world might have different views/experiences.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Genitals are not a smooth terrain and sometimes it gets tricky to cover all the areas which you want to cover. I do not recommend using any types of razors on or around genitals just because of the possibility of a cut.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my opinion using a good quality trimmer (with a guard) to trim the pubes and then using a hair remover for the final touch lasts a good time. Do use a moisturizer regularly to keep them soft and avoid any chances of itchiness. As far as underarms are concerned, reaching them with a trimmer and applying hair remover can be tricky and hence shaving is the most suitable option. It will just add 4 5 extra minutes to your bath time during the weekends. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Laser hair removal is something that I have never tried and thinking of pulling the hair from their roots sends shivers through my spines.

Your mileage may vary.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my experience, the feeling I get after having sex isn't exactly what you would call &quot;sleepiness&quot;, but it isn't far off from sleepiness.  I would describe it as being extremely relaxed, content, and at peace with the world.  I should mention that I have insomnia, so the only thing that really makes me sleepy is sleeping pills.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After sex, I don't drop off to sleep, but I definitely don't want to go anywhere or do anything.  I would imagine that most people, of whatever gender and orientation, feel more or less the same way after intercourse.  After all, if sex didn't feel so good, and if it wasn't so fulfilling, we probably wouldn't have so much of it.  :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I guess I would say that I become very sedate and relaxed following an orgasm, but no, I don't immediately fall asleep or become comatose.  I think it's more like I am so happy and satisfied that I don't feel the need to get up or do anything except cuddle.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I understand it, this is an effect of the hormone called oxytocin.  It strengthens emotional bonds, encourages a sense of intimacy, and helps to instill a feeling of being connected with your partner, your family, and your friends.  " />

Sex with a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; circumcised man was associated with pain, dryness and difficulty&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reaching orgasm (O'Hara 1999).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And further down:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The function of the foreskin for women in intercourse is to seal the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; natural lubrication inside the vagina and provide a gentle internal&#xD;&#xA;&gt; massaging action. The intact penis moves in and out of its foreskin,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; which provides a frictionless, rolling, gliding sensation. Intact men&#xD;&#xA;&gt; tend to make shorter strokes that keep their bodies in contact with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the clitoris more, thus aiding female orgasm (O’Hara 1999). On the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; other hand, the circumcised penis functions like a piston during&#xD;&#xA;&gt; intercourse – the head of the penis actually scrapes the lubrication&#xD;&#xA;&gt; out of the vagina with each stroke. As the man thrusts, his skin rubs&#xD;&#xA;&gt; against the vaginal entrance, causing discomfort, and sometimes pain&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (O’Hara 1999, Bensley 2001).

If you're interested, there's an account of the events and a rundown of the attacks at: the **[Science-Based Medicine][1]** website.  The AAP policy statement, **[the technical appendix][2]**, and **[the rebuttal of the intactivist attacks][3]** are also worth a look&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm no expert and I haven't got time to wade through the claims and counterclaims.  Pediatricians may not have a direct stake in encouraging circumcisions, but obstetricians do, and it wouldn't surprise me if pediatricians tended to support their colleagues, so I'm not going to automatically accept the AAP's verdict. On the other hand, most pediatricians are strongly aligned emotionally as well as professionally toward protecting the welfare of children, so I am not going to automatically dismiss what they say, either.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I *do* know enough science to recognize specious and dishonest statistics and arguments, and to be offended by them, and that's what I'm seeing from the intactivists.  So for now, it's my policy to assume that anti-circumcision &quot;studies&quot; are bogus unless they have ironclad scientific credentials.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just as one example, another answer to this question cites a Danish study. The lead author of that study, Morten Frisch, is also the leading intactivist who wrote the attack on the AAP policy.  A followup analysis in that same journal cites serious discrepancies in the data and the methods used in that paper.  This is a typical pattern.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One reason I am so skeptical of the intactivist propaganda is that they routinely claim that large percentages of all circumcised men have a variety of serious sexual dysfunctions.  Yet in my own in-depth survey of 60 men who are in long-term heterosexual relationships, the vast majority were circumcised and none had any of these supposedly &quot;common&quot; disorders.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I first became aware of the movement behind this BS as a result of [an article in Popular Psychology][4] that made claims like this one:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In a landmark study of US women, 85% who had experienced both&#xD;&#xA;&gt; circumcised and intact men preferred sex with intact men.   Sex with a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; circumcised man was associated with pain, dryness and difficulty&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reaching orgasm (O'Hara 1999).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And further down:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The function of the foreskin for women in intercourse is to seal the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; natural lubrication inside the vagina and provide a gentle internal&#xD;&#xA;&gt; massaging action. The intact penis moves in and out of its foreskin,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; which provides a frictionless, rolling, gliding sensation. Intact men&#xD;&#xA;&gt; tend to make shorter strokes that keep their bodies in contact with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the clitoris more, thus aiding female orgasm (O’Hara 1999). On the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; other hand, the circumcised penis functions like a piston during&#xD;&#xA;&gt; intercourse – the head of the penis actually scrapes the lubrication&#xD;&#xA;&gt; out of the vagina with each stroke. As the man thrusts, his skin rubs&#xD;&#xA;&gt; against the vaginal entrance, causing discomfort, and sometimes pain&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (O’Hara 1999, Bensley 2001). Far from making sex better for women,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; circumcision decreases female satisfaction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I tracked down this &quot;landmark study&quot; and it consists of preliminary findings from a survey that consists of heavily loaded leading questions.  The respondents were all recruited through ads and notices placed in radical leftist magazines, including the newsletter of an anti-circumcision organization.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It has been 15 years since it was published, with no &quot;final&quot; paper.  So why rely on a very sketchy preliminary report?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And the answer becomes clear when you actually read it:  the second part of the quote above isn't even based on anything in the survey questions.  It is purely the opinion of the authors, unsupported by ***any*** research, even the phony kind.

The problem is that the anti-circumcision (or &quot;intactivist&quot;) lobby has turned into a radicalized extremist movement that has specialized in producing propaganda and falsified research studies, so the noise:signal ratio is getting extremely high.  So it will be very hard or impossible to get unbiased answers to your question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fundamental difficulty in answering your question is that it depends on subjective answers to survey data.  There is no objective way to measure sexual satisfaction, so we simply have to ask people. Normally that's a relatively minor problem unless you are comparing answers across cultures. However, when one side of an issue is passionate and politicized, you are unlikely to get objective responses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If a woman believes strongly that circumcision is genital mutilation, that it is cruel and unnatural, how likely is it that she will report equal satisfaction with circumcised and uncircumcised lovers?  In the first place her satisfaction will be influenced by her feelings about circumcision, and her answers will be further biased by her desire to promote the anti-circumcision cause. In addition, it is a safe bet that she will be far more willing to fill out a questionnaire or answer an online survey than someone with no strong feelings on the subject.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A second problem with research on both male and female satisfaction with circumcision is the geographic and cultural bias inherent in selecting a survey population.  For example, in many European countries few men are circumcised.  Those that are are typically Muslims, Jews, or men with medical problems that required circumcision. This means that a study that does a naive statistical comparison of, e.g., &quot;circumcised and uncircumcised Belgian men,&quot; is ignoring huge confounding factors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is simply no way to avoid substantial bias of some kind in a world in which circumcision is strongly associated with certain cultures, nationalities, and religions and not others. If a woman says she prefers circumcised to uncircumcised men, and it turns out that the only uncircumcised men she's had sex with are Danes and the only circumcised men she's had sex with are Israeli, it is impossible to determine how much of her preference is based on a piece of skin and how much it is based on national and cultural preference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The World Health Organization has accumulated substantial evidence that circumcision reduces the transmission of HIV and other STDs.  A few years ago, as evidence on the STD question accumulated, the American Association of Pediatricians moved from a neutral stance to a mildly pro-circumcision stance.

Sexual orientation is hard to define and questioning one's own sexuality  is part of the normal development of each individual. It is not to be compared to a fad or a trend, people have been bullied, suppressed and so on because of their sexual orientation. The legalization of gay marriage in the United States is a step towards acceptance, and people might be more open to trying to understand their own sexuality if they know they are accepted as they are. It won't promote the LGBT community, and won't make people want to &quot;change&quot; their sexual orientation but might encourage those who live in fear or shame to be proud and open as they are.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. I think the term &quot;contagious&quot; is incorrect here. I would believe that in parts of the world where more people are open and discovering one's sexuality is encouraged, it might be more frequent for men and women to have experiences with people of the same sex.

The epidemiology&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in Europe is similar, with at least half of the population&#xD;&#xA;&gt; seropositive for HSV-1. In the developing world, HSV-1 is almost&#xD;&#xA;&gt; universal, and usually acquired from intimate contact with family in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; early childhood (Whitley et al., 1998).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Epidemiologists think HSV-1 may now be the cause of half or almost half of all genital herpes infections in the U.S.:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Until recently, scientists assumed that HSV-1 infections were not&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sexually transmitted. Now, scientists know that either type can be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; found in either the oral or genital area, as well as at other sites.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In fact, **researchers estimate that HSV-1 is responsible for up to half&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of all new cases of genital herpes.**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To infect people, HSV-1 and HSV-2 must get into the body through&#xD;&#xA;&gt; broken skin or a mucous membrane, such as inside the mouth or in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; genital area. In addition to the fluid from fever blisters, each virus&#xD;&#xA;&gt; can be carried in bodily fluids like saliva, semen, and fluid in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; female genital tract.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Both herpes viruses may cause genital infections, and both can be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; contagious even if the infected person does not have active symptoms&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or visible blisters. [Source: [Herpes simplex virus][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;HSV-1 and HSV-2 produce &quot;clinically indistinguishable facial and genital lesions.&quot;  The main reason HSV-1 is less noticeable as a genital infection is that &quot;HSV-2 causes symptomatic genital recurrences at a much higher frequency than HSV-1.&quot; [Source: [Genital Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 in Women][2]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**tl;dr**: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both viruses infect the mouth, throat, genitals and anus and can be transmitted by surface contact as well as exchange of fluids.  Given a choice, HSV-1 is less bad because it remains dormant longer and creates fewer outbreaks.  Otherwise, there's no difference in terms of pain, lesions, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/herpes-simplex-virus#ixzz3hg4fgkkQ&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/1/150.full" />

Many sex toys come with cleaning instructions on the package, and obviously, it makes sense to follow such instructions if you still have the package.

If the toy is Pyrex, you can just toss it in the dishwasher.  Non-Pyrex glass should not be exposed to high temperatures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Stainless Steel: If a stainless steel toy is electrical, either unplug it or remove the batteries, then wash with warm soapy water. If the stainless steel toy is not electrical, you can either soak in in a mixture of water and bleach (10% to 20% bleach, the rest water), or boil it, or just toss it in the dishwasher. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Hard Plastic:  Wash with warm soapy water.  You can use antibacterial soap if you want.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Silicone:  Either boil it for 10 minutes, wash it in warm soapy water (antibacterial soap works well), or toss it in the dishwasher.  If the toy is a vibrator, don't boil it, or it will never vibrate again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Porous materials (rubber, vinyl, cyberskin, nylon, and leather)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Rubber materials: There are all kinds of problems with rubber toys. For starters, rubber is ridiculously porous, which makes it very hard to clean thoroughly.  For another thing, we are starting to learn about all sorts of harmful chemicals that can be leeched out of rubber.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether a particular rubber toy contains such chemicals.  As a result of all of these issues, the best course of action is to always use condoms on your rubber toys.  This removes the need to wash the toy thoroughly.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Cyberskin/Vinyl: Again, these materials are difficult to clean properly because they are so porous. Use warm water, **no soap**.  Leave them out to dry.  If they become sticky, which is likely to happen, you can apply a dusting of corn starch or powdered sex toy lubricant (but corn starch is waaaaaay cheaper).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Nylon: Throw it in the washing machine, or hand wash with warm soapy water (antibacterial soap is a good idea).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-  Leather: Hard to clean without causing damage.  You can use warm soapy water, or you can use leather cleaner.  If you want/need to, you can apply leather conditioner afterwards.  If there are metal parts, coat them with clear nail polish before cleaning the toy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/sexual_health/sexuality/sex_toys.php#1" />

I've talked to parents and pre-school teachers who have described girls and boys masturbating and having what certainly looked like orgasms.  As you note, Kinsey described numerous cases of young girls humping furniture or cushions and appearing to orgasm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for boys prior to semenarche, this is from a private communication:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Many boys continue to masturbate after orgasm, and since they do not&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ejaculate they maintain their erection.  Alfred Kinsey... reported&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that half of all preadolescent boys(around 12 or younger) were able to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; experience two orgasms in a row, and almost a third were able to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; experience five or more one after the other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then there's this exchange on Reddit:  [Guys - were you multi-orgasmic before your first ejaculation? Did your orgasms change after you reached puberty?][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And [this comment on it][2]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I don't remember when I had my first orgasm, so it must have been&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pretty young. I do remember a bunch of Cub Scouts on a camping trip&#xD;&#xA;&gt; talking about it in a tent, away from the grownups, and then one boy&#xD;&#xA;&gt; whipped it out to demonstrate for the boys who'd never done it. So of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; course this turned into a circle jerk with i think 4 boys having&#xD;&#xA;&gt; orgasms for the first time and several more including me having&#xD;&#xA;&gt; multiples for the first time. We were, maybe 8?  or 9?  at the time.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Based on that tiny sample I'm guessing all boys can do it, but only&#xD;&#xA;&gt; some figure it out or get told about it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And [this one][3]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I don't remember when I started jerking off so I must have been pretty&#xD;&#xA;&gt; young. I remember &quot;getting caught&quot; by a babysitter when I was about 7.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; She put me to bed super early and then came in &quot;to check on me&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; without knocking. (She made a big deal of it to my parents and they&#xD;&#xA;&gt; told her that doors are for knocking on and never hired her again.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And finally, this letter to AJOG, which takes us back to the womb:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Giorgi, Giorgio, and Siccardi, Marco (1996). &quot;Ultrasonographic observation of a female fetus' sexual behavior in utero,&quot; American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 175, 3(1, part 1), 753.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; To the Editors: Fetal movement offers the opportunity for observing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fetal behavior in utero. Parents, curious to know their child's sex,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; frequently request visualization of the fetal genitalia.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; During second-trimester ultrasonographic examinations it is usual to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; see fetuses explore their body and their environment. They handle&#xD;&#xA;&gt; their own feet, head, genitalia, umbilical cord, and so on.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; We recently observed a female fetus at 32 weeks' gestation touching&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the vulva with fingers of [her] right hand. The caressing movement was&#xD;&#xA;&gt; centered primarily on the region of the clitoris. Movements stopped&#xD;&#xA;&gt; after 30 to 40 seconds, and started again after a few moments.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Further, these light touches were repeated and were associated with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; short, rigid movements of the pelvis and legs. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; After another break, in addition to this behavior, the fetus&#xD;&#xA;&gt; contracted the muscles of the trunk and limbs, and the climax,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; clonicotonic movements [rapid muscle contractions] of the body,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; followed. Finally she relaxed and rested.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; We observed this behavior for about 20 minutes. The mother was an&#xD;&#xA;&gt; active and interested witness, conversing with observers about her&#xD;&#xA;&gt; child's experience.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Evidence of male fetuses' excitement reflex in utero, such as erection&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or ″masturbation” movements, has been previously reported. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The current observation seems to show not only that the excitement&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reflex can be evoked in female fetuses at the third trimester of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; gestation but also that the orgasmic reflex can be elicited during&#xD;&#xA;&gt; intrauterine life. This would agree with the physiologic features of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; female sexuality: The female sexual response is separate from&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reproductive functions and doesn't need a full sexual maturity to be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; explicit.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No one is going to allow adults to do serious research on kids having orgasms, so your last question - Is the physiology of a prepubescent orgasm the same as that of an adult orgasm? - probably can't be answered scientifically.  However, all the people I've talked to about this agree that the physiology appears to be the same, and as Giorgi and Siccardi say, it appears to be fully mature by the third trimester.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/t0d7g/guys_were_you_multiorgasmic_before_your_first/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.quora.com/As-a-boy-did-you-ever-masturbate-to-orgasm-several-times-in-a-row-before-you-were-old-enough-to-ejaculate/answers/5247864&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.quora.com/As-a-boy-did-you-ever-masturbate-to-orgasm-several-times-in-a-row-before-you-were-old-enough-to-ejaculate/answers/5882785" />

Also the sexual scientist Ernest Bornemann, did researches on this topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;(Bornemann was born 1915 in Germany, lived in Germany, UK and since 1970 in Austria, where he founded the “Österreichische Gesellschaft für Sexualforschung” = “Austrian society of sexual research”. He died in 1995. In the last two decades of his life he was respectfully called the “Sex-Papst” = “pope of sex” in TV and print-magazines, because when ever any sex-related topic was discussed in public, he was asked in talkshows and interviews.)&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;During his researches (mainly interviews with adults who talked about their childhood, but also findings from journeys to other cultures), Bornemann came to the result, that when ever a child has found out how to masturbate, it does it again and again, because they experience it as something lustful. And during this interviews he also found out, that many adults remember to have had spasms combined with an intense feeling of arousal, which can be interpreted as an orgasm. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And this is exactly what I have in memory from my own childhood. I remember, that those moments was rare, and way less intense then the orgasms that I had when I was able to ejaculate, but there definitely was some kind of mini-climax.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since the “hardware” of a child's body is fully equipped with everything that is necessary to react on sexual stimulation, I find it not very surprising that also children can have orgasms, even if they might be less intense. But as far as I know, there is very little research on this topic nowadays. So I'm not sure, if there are any serious resources, which can tell you, if all children can have orgasms, or if some of them only become able to it when they reach the age of puberty.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let me add some words on Ernest Bornemann:  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bornemann did not interview only people from Europe. He also made journeys to foreign countries where he met cultures, that many of us tend to call “primitive”. Most of those cultures have thoughts of morality, that are very different from western world's morality. So Bornemann also met cultures, where sexual interaction with minors is not a tabu, and Bornemann learned a lot about prepubescent sexuality from those cultures. But when in the early 1990ies publications of Bornemann form the 1970ies became public, he was strongly attacked and he quickly lost his glorious state of a “pope of sex” and from those days on he was shunned by magazines and TV-stations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In those publications Bornemann said, that sexual interaction among children and between children and adults can help to lower the level of aggression of children, and would lead to mentally healthier kids. In 1977 in an Austrian Newspaper (“Arbeiterzeitung”) he also advocated rooms in schools, where children could experience their sexuality without repression. This of course found no majority, but in 1977 this was not a big deal and soon was forgotten. But 15 or 20 years later, when it was announced again, it marked the end of his career." />

Accordingly and from my point a view, the &quot;lesbian bed death&quot; as we know it, is a myth.&#xA;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/truth-about-lesbian-bed-death-its-complicated-1210134" />

This “somewhere” is your blood.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Fact 2:**  &#xD;&#xA;What ever we eat and drink either stays in the gastrointestinal tract and will be excreted through the rectum (maybe after it was transformed by bacteria living in your guts), or it will be resorbed into your body. And being resorbed means, that (at least as first step) it becomes part of your blood.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In your veins, all the molecules, that passed this barrier circulate through your body. Fat, sugar, proteins, water, alcohol, maybe some medication, this all is in your blood. But also lots of other molecules circulate through your veins after a meal, until they are converted into other molecules in your liver (the first station blood from your stomach has to pass), or excreted by your kidneys as part of urine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Fact 3:**  &#xD;&#xA;Pineapples contain two molecule that are responsible for it's characteristic taste and smell. They are named “ethyl butyrate” and “butyl butyrate”. Both belong to a group of substances, that are called “fruit esters” because chemically they are esters, and because all of them intensively smell like ripe fruits. (Some of them smell like apple, strawberry, oranges, apricots or other fruits, and a mixture of ethyl butyrate and butyl butyrate just smells like pineapples).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Those molecules are rather small (compared to other organic molecules), so they easily can pass from your stomach and bowel into your blood, and later into the liquid from what semen is produced. This can go much faster than it's dismantling in the liver or excretion by your kidneys.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So this is the way how the taste of your food comes into your semen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Also note:**  &#xD;&#xA;There is a German magazine with the name “Men's Health” (yes, it has an english title, but it is all in German: http://www.menshealth.de ). And about 15 or 20 years ago they asked some couples to test how food influences the taste of semen. As far as I remember it was about 10 couples who noted for a period of many weeks, what the male parters ate, and how their sperm tasted afterwards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They reported, that coffee, onions and garlic produced the worst taste. When the men ate no meat for a longer period of time, the semen tasted better. The best taste was produced when they drank fruit-juices, and among those juices pineapple-juice was the winner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is of course not a scientific research, because it did not meet all conditions that are necessary for a scientific research, but I think it is good enough to refer to when talking about the taste of sperm." />

Unless you kill the hair follicles, the method of removal won't affect the growth rate at all, in spite of many myths to the contrary.  So the time for hair to regrow to a certain length depends entirely on how much of each hair you remove.  Razors lop it off at skin level.  Tweezers, waxing, sugaring, etc. pull it out by the roots so it takes longer to grow back above the surface.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any razor you can use on your face should work for everything else except your penis and scrotum.  For those two areas, I recommend a multi-bladed manual razor.&#xD;&#xA;My partner uses one that has five blades in each replaceable cartridge and it takes him only a minute or two per week to swipe the hairs from the shaft and around the base of the penis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also recommend using scissors every week or two to trim the pubic hair above the penis to an inch or so if yours grows much longer than that.  Some men prefer to shave it completely, and some women prefer it that way.  (If in doubt, ask!) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One interesting tidbit:  trimming or shaving the long pubes down there can make a man's penis appear larger from his own perspective, contributing to a subtle confidence boost!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what about the balls?  Most men have a lot of long hairs growing from the scrotum.  If you don't care about getting oral in that area, that's fine.  But if you do, you need to learn how to shave your scrotum and then keep it hair-free.  This takes longer, perhaps 10 minutes a week.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A lot of men are scared to take a razor down there.  Don't be.  Modern multi-bladed razors work fine as long as you stretch the skin smooth and use a light touch. Don't scrape hard the way you shave your face!  The skin on the scrotum is much thinner and more delicate, and you don't want to shave the tops off the little sebum glands the hairs grow out of.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When my SO shaves his shaft and scrotum, he does it dry with a very light touch.  He prefers shaving dry in that area because wet skin is softer and easier to cut and shaving cream just interferes with his vision.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whatever you do, do NOT try using an electric razor on your penis or scrotum. Some electrics do work down there, but most don't, and figuring out which is which can be a bloody and painful process!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tweezing, waxing, and &quot;sugaring&quot; pull your hair out by its roots.  This hurts and leaves the area red and angry for a while, but it lasts longer before you can feel a stubble.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Electrolysis or laser treatment can remove hair permanently, but both are expensive and it takes multiple sessions over ~6 months to get almost all of the hair.  Lasers work best with darker hair and fair skin, so that option may not work for you if you have dark skin or very light hair." />

When this is done by people without a transgender experience, it is likely the most accurate specific term.&#xD;&#xA;* *[Cisgender][6]* - Finally, as a compliment to transgender, it's worth adding that a cisgender person is generally considered to be someone whose gender experiences and their designated sex align.  I.e. someone that's not within the trans* realm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Those are some basics.  Following the links to the various terms can provide more information about each of these, as well as references to other related terms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://gender.wikia.com/wiki/Assigned_Sex&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexual&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvestism&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/what-does-the-asterisk-in-trans-stand-for/" />

When you don't ejaculate you can have an erection for many hours, and in this time you can have sex with many different partners.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you practice tantric sex (the syllable “tan” in “tantra” means “stretch, extend, expand”), then you prolong your arousal by holding still just before you get an orgasm to avoid the orgasm, and this is what those emperors might have done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When a man does so, and has, let's say 10 hours of sex every day, and spends only 5 minutes for each partner, then he has sex in just one day with 120 people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just to give an other number: At Oct 12 2004 the porn-actor [Lisa Sparxxx][1] was penetrated by 919 different men in just one day.

It appears that all boys can do this prior to semenarche (first ejaculation). After semenarche, it can happen naturally and some men can do it deliberately. Verbal descriptions of dry orgasms by men are remarkably similar to the way women describe clitoral or vaginal orgasms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because it is ejaculation, not orgasm, that triggers detumescence, a man does not necessarily lose his erection after a non-ejaculatory orgasms (NEO) and is therefore able to continue his sexual activity.  This means that any discussion of NEOs tends also to involve the topic of male multiple orgasms (MMOs).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Male Orgasms in Childhood**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Boys have been observed masturbating in the womb and during infancy and early childhood, apparently including orgasm. Many teenage boys and adult men can remember masturbating to orgasm before the first time they ejaculated.  Often they are unclear about whether a dry orgasm should count as a &quot;real&quot; orgasm, but the descriptions they give are essentially identical to the ones girls and women use to describe their own orgasms.  Kinsey claimed that half of the pre-teen boys he studied were able to have several orgasms in a row.

They found “that detumescence&#xD;&#xA;&gt; does not always follow an orgasm, **that a nonejaculatory orgasm can&#xD;&#xA;&gt; occur prior to as well as after an ejaculatory orgasm,** and that it is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; possible to have a series of orgasms. Some of the men reported always&#xD;&#xA;&gt; having been multiply orgasmic, whereas others experienced it&#xD;&#xA;&gt; relatively late in life.

One is natural and typically occurs immediately before or after a normal ejaculatory orgasm, especially if the man has been highly aroused for an unusually long period of time. &quot;Preshocks&quot; are dry orgasms leading up to the primary ejaculatory orgasm, usually with a separation of 5-15 seconds. &quot;Aftershocks&quot; occur most often as a result of strong manual stimulation during and after an ejaculatory orgasm, but some men routinely have a series of orgasms even during regular vaginal sex.

They recorded extraordinary amounts of data during more&#xD;&#xA;&gt; than 10,000 hours of observation and recordings of more than 750&#xD;&#xA;&gt; subjects masturbating and having sex in their Los Angeles lab, still a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; record in the field.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Among their 282 male subjects, they found 33 who could have anywhere&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from 2 to 16 orgasms in a row without losing their erections. (Orgasms&#xD;&#xA;&gt; were defined and determined by recording and measuring the rapid&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increases in the heart rate and the involuntary contractions of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; anal sphincter and pelvic muscles.) These 33 men averaged four orgasms&#xD;&#xA;&gt; per session, which was typically 20-30 minutes, with the record held&#xD;&#xA;&gt; by a young man who had 16 consecutive orgasms in less than an hour, an&#xD;&#xA;&gt; average of less than 4 minutes for each one! The subjects also&#xD;&#xA;&gt; included one man who could have multiple ejaculations in a row without&#xD;&#xA;&gt; loss of erection. [Ibid.]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In 32 out of 33 cases, these men were having non-ejaculatory orgasms (NEOs) before (optionally) a final orgasm with ejaculation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Personal Observations**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My long-term partner regularly experiences both kinds of NEO.

In any case the missionary position was not some Anglo invention; surveys suggest it is, and no doubt always has been, a common sexual position in most of the world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More recent research has suggested a link between the term and a misunderstanding with roots in the respective work of Alfred Kinsey, Robert J. Priest, and Bronislaw Malinowski.  From a [follow up article][1] on The Straight Dope:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[Divinity School Professor Robert J. Priest] unearthed what he believes to be the missionary position urtext, namely the following quote from Alfred Kinsey's Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948): &quot;It will be recalled that [anthropologist Bronislaw] Malinowski ([The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia,] 1929) records the nearly universal use of a totally different [sexual] position among the Trobrianders in the Southwestern Pacific; and that he notes that caricatures of the English-American position are performed around the communal campfires, to the great amusement of the natives who refer to the position as the 'missionary position.'&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;According to Priest, however, Malinowski's book says nothing about the missionary position as we now understand the term. What it does say at widely separated points is that (a) Trobrianders play ribald games at gatherings during the full moon; (b) islanders who work for whites sometimes mimic the inept (in their estimation) copulatory flailings of their employers; and (c) some Trobrianders object to public displays of affection between lovers, which they term misinari si bubunela, &quot;missionary fashion,&quot; viewing such things as an immoral Christian import. Furthermore, Kinsey in his book claims that the Christian church once considered non-MP sex sinful. Priest conjectures that Kinsey conflated these disparate elements to come up with the missionary position tale, apparently never bothering to compare his faulty recollection against Malinowski's words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Priest, a divinity school professor, believes that from there missionary position gradually took hold as a way of marginalizing the Christian take on things, but he suggests that Kinsey, whatever his motives, made an honest mistake. Others take a less charitable view of the sex-research pioneer's approach to the facts. E. Michael Jones's Degenerate Moderns: Modernity as Rationalized Sexual Misbehavior (1993), which Priest cites in passing, blames Kinsey for the discredited (by me among others) legend that the Vatican has the world's largest pornography collection. Evidently having called some of the same people I did, Jones records the usual denials that the Vatican has a pornography collection, and traces belief to the contrary to Kinsey, who used to get laughs in lectures by claiming that the trove of smut he'd amassed for his research was second only to, or in fact larger than, the pile of porn possessed by the Holy See. Kinsey's basis for such statements: A casual remark by a visitor who'd been to Rome and on seeing Kinsey's collection commented (I presume in jest) that it was almost as large as the Vatican's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Jones remarks sternly that Kinsey &quot;seems to have made no effort to contact the Vatican&quot; and that &quot;there is every reason to believe that he continued to make the statement even knowing that it was false.&quot; Having occasionally been tempted to embellish a tale to get a rise out of an audience, I can't be too harsh on the old voyeur, who whatever his defects materially advanced our understanding of sex. Just the same, I'm happy now to help set the record straight.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2601/assuming-the-missionary-position-again" />

Therefore the scholars strongly&#xD;&#xA;&gt; recommend circumcision for male.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Source:** http://convertingtoislam.com/circum.html&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;References:&#xD;&#xA;-----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

Since you need to insert it, people who are not used to being penetrated may find it harder or more uncomfortable to place it correctly. However, this caveat extends to many foreign objects, such as fingers or penises. With practice, placing the female condom gets easier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[How to use a female condom:][1] &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. Put spermicide or lubricant on the outside of the closed end.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. Find a comfortable position. You can stand with one foot on a chair, sit on the edge of a chair, lie down, or squat.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. Squeeze together the sides of the inner ring at the closed end of the condom and insert it into the vagina like a tampon.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. Push the inner ring into the vagina as far as it can go — until it reaches the cervix.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 5. Pull out your finger and let the outer ring hang about an inch outside the vagina.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;If you want to use the female condom for anal intercourse, follow above instructions for inserting it into the anus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;During vaginal intercourse, it is normal for the female condom to move side to side. Stop intercourse if the penis slips between the condom and the walls of the vagina or if the outer ring is pushed into the vagina. As long as your partner has not yet ejaculated, you can gently remove the condom from the vagina, add extra spermicide or lubricant, and insert it once again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To remove the condom safely, grasp the outer ring and twist the condom like you would a plastic bag. Pull it out gently, and throw it away.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is a [United AIDS fund video][2] explaining the female condom and demonstrating placement and usage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/female-condom&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRZH5ASO-eM" />

For example, a certain piece of clothing might be fetishized in one culture or subculture, commonplace in another, and totally unheard of in a third.  A fetish for short skirts might be mildly scandalous in 1950s Europe, totally unacceptable in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and utterly unremarkable in modern Los Angeles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given the essentially infinite range of possible fetishes, and the way each culture and each individual approaches their interest in and exploration of their fetishes, there can be no objective, universal declaration that fetishes are, by their nature, dysfunctional.

When I started writing this answer, it had been my understanding that impotence referred to an inability for a man to get his female partner pregnant, due to any number of conditions.  I thought it was independent of ED, except for that ED is one form of impotence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the [Wikipedia article][1] about Erectile Dysfunction suggests that &quot;impotence&quot; is a synonym.  In fact, apparently &quot;impotence&quot; derives from the Latin phrase *impotentia coeundi*, which refers specifically from an inability to insert the penis into the vagina.  So, that sounds pretty specifically like ED.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it would seem that, in a sexual context, impotence and erectile dysfunction refer to the same phenomenon.  That being said, I don't think I was the only person to associate the word &quot;impotence&quot; with general male sterility or infertility, so in colloquial contexts that may be a common secondary meaning of the term.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction" />

Unfortunately, I can't find the article I'm thinking of, so I'll paraphrase for now and update this later if I find it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, many mammals and birds routinely watch others mate.  For a lot of them, it's essential sex ed, and they will have trouble mating successfully as adults if they never see others of their species do it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many *social* animals also pay close attention to who mates with whom, because that is an important type of information about the status competition within the group.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But voyeurism implies more than curiosity.  It implies (A) getting turned on by the mating activities of others, and (B) perhaps seeking it out as a pleasure in its own right.  And it turns out that (A) sometimes happens, but (B) seems to be solely a human thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sea lions are one of the species that seem to get aroused when others near them are having sex.  If I remember correctly, young males in some &quot;tournament&quot; species are more likely to challenge the Alpha male after seeing him mount a female, but I'm not sure that counts as sexual arousal or just opportunism.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Summary** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Among animals, particularly social animals, curiosity is common, but arousal is rare.

You can try it out, if you know a place where toads and frogs are living. Just place a stone of about the size of a frog in shallow water and wait.

Medical history knows many cases of people who lived without any handicaps after this region of brain was damaged (most famous is [Phineas Gage][2]). But the victims personality did change dramatically. People, who was noble and restrained became unpredictable and instinctive. They lost discipline and self-control.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So scientists believe, that the function of the human frontal lobe is to control the impulses and signals, that come from the rest of the brain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A man sees a naked woman in the neighbors house. The parts of his brain, that are responsible for sexual arousal, will be activated, and most parts of this man's brain say: “Go to that naked woman and have sex with her. Go now! Go! Fuck her!”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the frontal lobe says: “No, this not a good idea. You will get troubles if you do it. It is not wise. Stay here.” And so, this man stays outside of the woman's house. But still the primeval parts of his brain fire impulses saying “look at those boobs and ass! Fuck her! NOW!” And in this situation the frontal lobe might say: “well, it's still not a good idea, but you can stay here and keep watching.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And this is what voyeurism is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But this is impossible for people with a frontal lobe that is not working properly. A man like Phineas Gage is unable to stay where he is when he sees a naked woman. He must go to her and he must try to have sex with her, because this is what the primeval parts of his brain call for. And there is no intelligent controller who stops the man from always doing what he wants.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What has this to do with the question? With animal-voyeurism?  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, the frontal lobe is that part of a humans body, that most of all distinguishes humans from animals. Some animals (apes, dogs) have rudimentary equivalents of this part of brain, but most animals have nothing that can be compared with it. And a humans frontal lobe is really big (see the picture at [frontal lobe at Wikipedia][3]). I guess is is a quarter of the whole human brain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So animals have no “voice” in their brain that stops them from following the primeval drives. When a male hamster sees or smells a female hamster, he is unable to stay hidden behind a bush and just watch her. Either he don't recognize her at all, or he wants to go to her to have sex with her. There is nothing in between.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And this is true for all animals that don't have a very high developed frontal lobe, and so it is true for all animals except Homo sapiens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Being sexual aroused and attracted by an individual without trying to intercourse with this individual is - as far as I know - not possible for animals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://books.google.at/books?id=L_Hedxcy8O4C&amp;pg=PA304&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=behavioural%20dummy%20-%22for%20dummies%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vHqvHVtl7h&amp;sig=7SeAmD98yjCb9WrbE3SSM-EjEnM&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIkar8zOeYxwIVyD8UCh1Msgcx#v=onepage&amp;q=behavioural%20dummy%20-%22for%20dummies%22&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe" />

There is nothing in between.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And this is true for all animals that don't have a very highly developed frontal lobe, and so it is true for all animals except Homo sapiens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Being sexually aroused and attracted by an individual without trying to have intercourse with this individual is--as far as I know--not possible for animals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://books.google.at/books?id=L_Hedxcy8O4C&amp;pg=PA304&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=behavioural%20dummy%20-%22for%20dummies%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vHqvHVtl7h&amp;sig=7SeAmD98yjCb9WrbE3SSM-EjEnM&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIkar8zOeYxwIVyD8UCh1Msgcx#v=onepage&amp;q=behavioural%20dummy%20-%22for%20dummies%22&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe" />

We know that men consume much more porn than women. Studies and general polls suggest that by percent, for every man that watches porn at least once weekly, there's one woman that doesn't. This means that with so many more men doing it, it's more likely that a man will succumb to this addiction. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It has been known to cause relationship issues from a lack of sexual interest, a general loss of affection, and may even interfere with work and extracurricular activities. I don't know of any studies that have proven which genre is more common, but if I had to place a bet, I would say that those that engage in the highest risk factors are the &quot;most addictive&quot; types.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This means, the more likely it is that it would end a relationship or put the user in jail, the more likely it is to cause addiction. I don't really even feel like I should be posting a list here, but think about the worst possible porn that you would never watch because it's repulsive. Someone out there right now is probably addicted to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even worse, if you watched such a video for a minute, you might even want to watch more of it. It's a sort of reverse psychology effect, where the more taboo/repulsive something is, the more likely you are to be fascinated by it, or even addicted. I don't know the technical term for this, but I've seen it plenty enough to know that it exists and is a very powerful mechanism.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Left untreated, it tends to get worse, not better, so therapy can often prevent this total loss of sexual attraction for a specific partner/real people. Note that this is rarely what could be considered permanent. It can generally be corrected with therapy, group sessions, and so on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography_addiction" />

RISUG will cause partial blockage of the vasa deferentia, and disruption of the sperm that pass through it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###The process&#xD;&#xA;Sperm are present in the ejaculate after RISUG has been administered, however they all have broken cell membranes, making them unviable. It is believed that the sperm are literally 'torn apart' by the ionisation of the polymer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to statements made by Dr Guha, one of the lead researchers on RISUG, There has been only one unplanned pregnancy among partners of the 250 volunteers who have been injected with RISUG (apparently due to a problem with the administered injection).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Clinical Progress&#xD;&#xA;RISUG is currently in 'stage 3 clinical' (human) trials:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;[Indian Council of Medical Research – RISUG][1]  &#xD;&#xA;This Phase III trial of RISUG as a male contraceptive is enrolling men in 4 Indian cities: New Delhi, Udhampur, Jaipur, and Ludhiana. The purpose of the study is to test the contraceptive efficacy of RISUG in a large and varied group of men. After being given RISUG, volunteers will be asked to make regular follow up visits. The study is not open to foreigners; participants must live in the local area so they can make follow-up visits. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Commercial Availability&#xD;&#xA;Not available outside of India (currently).

Increased friction during intercourse may cause lacerations in vaginal tissue. Drying the vagina also removes the natural antiseptic lactobacilli which can combat sexually transmitted diseases.

Thus, the two high pleasure and high or medium sensation&#xD;&#xA;&gt; orgasms, Types I and II, would qualify for the former term and the two&#xD;&#xA;&gt; medium and low pleasure orgasms for the latter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The two types of orgasm may be in response to male quality. Furthermore,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Apparently, at least in terms of the orgasm experience itself,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sometimes sex with oneself is more physically pleasurable than sex&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with a male partner, even when the latter provides sufficient sexual&#xD;&#xA;&gt; arousal to generate an orgasm. Fundamentally, these data would seem to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; contradict the Masters and Johnson (1965) view that masturbatory&#xD;&#xA;&gt; orgasms are the same as those achieved through intercourse, especially&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in terms of pleasure and sensation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the Costa, et al., study&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Women’s frequency of vaginal orgasm is associated with preference for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; deeper penile–vaginal stimulation, as indicated by greater importance&#xD;&#xA;&gt; given to longer than average penises. In contrast to the assertions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; common in sexology, penis size appears important to many women, and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; this is consistent with evolutionary hypotheses concerning the mate&#xD;&#xA;&gt; choice functions of vaginal orgasm and with the biological literature&#xD;&#xA;&gt; showing cryptic female choice for male genital morphology across many&#xD;&#xA;&gt; species. Like many men’s desire to have a longer than average penis,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the desire of (especially vaginally orgasmic) women to have a man with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a longer than average penis may reflect lessons learned from real&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sexual experiences rather than internalization of arbitrary&#xD;&#xA;&gt; stereotypes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some men have anxieties about their penis sizes and whether they can pleasure women. Men, no more worries! If you have a smaller-than-average penis size, just search for a woman that does not experience vaginal orgasms as much through deeper penetrative vaginal intercourse, and you may still have a great sex life, because you can just stimulate her clitoris, as the paper implies there is a difference between clitoral orgasm and vaginal orgasm! Though, if your wife has never been penetrated before or engaged in any sort of sexual activity, that's a different story. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Conclusion:** There seems to be 4 different types of orgasms. Type I and II are from &quot;good sex,&quot; and the other two types, Type III and IV, are from &quot;not-so-good-sex.&quot; These orgasms may differ in terms of oxytocin release, insuck, and sperm selection. Besides the 4 different types of orgasms achieved during intercourse, there is also the type of orgasm achieved during masturbation. Also, during sex, vaginal orgasm and clitoral orgasm are said to be different. Some women experience more vaginal orgasms through deeper-penetration sexual intercourse with men with longer penises, which may explain the preference for big penises and [anxiety of having a small penis in men.][1] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;References:&#xD;&#xA;-----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

The first sought to determine whether any or all the types&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of sex-with-partner orgasms identified in the latent-class analysis&#xD;&#xA;&gt; differed from solitary-masturbatory orgasms in terms of how they were&#xD;&#xA;&gt; described; the second set of analyses compared the four orgasms&#xD;&#xA;&gt; subtypes which emerged from the latent class analysis of data from the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sex with partner group on a set of external correlates.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, to support the **fourfold typology of orgasms**,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Apparently, at least in terms of the orgasm experience itself,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sometimes sex with oneself is more physically pleasurable than sex&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with a male partner, even when the latter provides sufficient sexual&#xD;&#xA;&gt; arousal to generate an orgasm.

In regards to emotion, Types I and II (good-sex orgasms) may involve (1) greater happiness in and (2) satisfaction with the current relationship, and (3) engender feelings of greater emotional closeness to the sex partner than not-as-good-sex orgasms (Type III and IV). Types I and II (good-sex orgasms), in contrast to expectations perhaps derived from Masters and Johnson’s (1965) conclusion that there is one type of female orgasm brought about by stimulation of the outer genitalia, are not more frequent during intercourse than Type III and IV (not-as-good orgasms). Finally, Types I and II (good-sex orgasms) are proved to be centered on the whole body, whereas Types III and IV are presumably more localized. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a different paper, Jannini, et al., conclude that the assumption that women may experience only the clitoral, external, orgasm is not based on the best available scientific evidence. In other words, some women do experience VAO (Vaginally Activated Orgasm), as opposed to CO (Clitoral Orgasm). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [A] more recent microdissection and immunohistochemical study of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; human vagina found that the distal AVW (Anterior Vaginal Wall) is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; significantly thicker than the proximal AVW  and that this region is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the most densely innervated area [10].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This may suggest that some female individuals may have a thicker and more densely innervated anterior vaginal wall than other female individuals, which may explain why some women experience orgasms through deep vaginal penetrations and others don't. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jannini, et al., also cite Odile Buisson, a gynecologist from Paris, expert in vaginal echography. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Basically, her position is that the VAO could be caused by contact of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the internal clitoris and the AVW. The proximity of the contact could&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be enhanced by reflex perineal contractions and vasomotor events,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; which occur in the case of erotic stimulation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jannini, et al., also point out that in 1998, there was the discovery that the clitoris and vagina might both play a role together simultaneously during vaginal intercourse. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; During vaginal penetration, in fact, the root of the clitoris is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; stretched by the penis and compressed against the AVW and the pubic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; symphysis [17]. The clitoris and vagina could be seen as an anatomical&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and functional unit being activated by vaginal penetration during&#xD;&#xA;&gt; intercourse. For this reason, and with the aim to involve the urethra&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and the surrounding exocrine glands, Jannini et al. named the area&#xD;&#xA;&gt; triggering the VAO as clito-urethro-vaginal (CUV) complex [22], a name&#xD;&#xA;&gt; probably more correctly able to describe the G-spot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jannini, et al., also cites support for different orgasms (clitoral and vaginal) based on Dr. Brody's findings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Stuart Brody, Professor of Psychology at the University of the West of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Scotland, UK, maintains that orgasm triggered by stimulation of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; vagina and cervix differs physiologically from climax induced by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; clitoral stimulation.

The first sought to determine whether any or all the types&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of sex-with-partner orgasms identified in the latent-class analysis&#xD;&#xA;&gt; differed from solitary-masturbatory orgasms in terms of how they were&#xD;&#xA;&gt; described; the second set of analyses compared the four orgasms&#xD;&#xA;&gt; subtypes which emerged from the latent class analysis of data from the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sex with partner group on a set of external correlates.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, to support the **fourfold typology of orgasms**,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Apparently, at least in terms of the orgasm experience itself,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sometimes sex with oneself is more physically pleasurable than sex&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with a male partner, even when the latter provides sufficient sexual&#xD;&#xA;&gt; arousal to generate an orgasm. Fundamentally, these data would seem to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; contradict the Masters and Johnson (1965) view that masturbatory&#xD;&#xA;&gt; orgasms are the same as those achieved through intercourse, especially&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in terms of pleasure and sensation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There seems to be 4 different types of orgasms.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The female participants are classified into &quot;types&quot;, based on subjective ratings: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Type I**, labelled ‘‘High Pleasure and Sensations,’’ described them as manifesting the most building, flooding, flushing, spurting, and throbbing sensations, as well as involving the most general spasm, relaxation, and emotional intimacy. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Type II** orgasms of 159 participants were labelled ‘‘High Pleasure, Medium Sensations’’ and defined by high scores on components relating to pleasure but noticeably lower on scores relating to internal sensations and feelings of relaxation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Type III**, labelled‘‘Medium Pleasure and Sensations,’’defined by relatively low scores in areas relating to internal sensations and in components describing pleasure and satisfaction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Type IV**,‘‘Low Pleasure and Sensation.’’&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In sum, whereas some orgasms achieved with a partner— Types I and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; II—proved to be of higher quality than those achieved on one’s own,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; perhaps meriting the label‘‘good-sex orgasms,’’ other, seemingly&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ‘‘not-as-good-sex’’ orgasms achieved with a partner—Types III and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; IV—proved to be of lower quality than those experienced all by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; oneself.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Thus, Types I and II were combined to create Type A (i.e., good-sex&#xD;&#xA;&gt; orgasms) and Types III and IV were combined into Type B (i.e.,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; not-as-good-sex orgasms) for use in the second stage of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; orgasm-typology validation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Types I and II (good-sex orgasms) may involve subjectively long-lasting orgasms, higher intensity of physical sensations (internal sensations related to the peristalsis of insuck creation), and higher ratings of intensity of non-physical sensations (specific non-physical dreamy, floaty sensations that also accompany oxytocin release). In regards to emotion, Types I and II (good-sex orgasms) may involve (1) greater happiness in and (2) satisfaction with the current relationship, and (3) engender feelings of greater emotional closeness to the sex partner than not-as-good-sex orgasms (Type III and IV). Types I and II (good-sex orgasms), in contrast to expectations perhaps derived from Masters and Johnson’s (1965) conclusion that there is one type of female orgasm brought about by stimulation of the outer genitalia, are not more frequent during intercourse than Type III and IV (not-as-good orgasms). Finally, Types I and II (good-sex orgasms) are proved to be centered on the whole body, whereas Types III and IV are presumably more localized. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a different paper, Jannini, et al., conclude that the assumption that women may experience only the clitoral, external, orgasm is not based on the best available scientific evidence. In other words, some women do experience VAO (Vaginally Activated Orgasm), as opposed to CO (Clitoral Orgasm). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [A] more recent microdissection and immunohistochemical study of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; human vagina found that the distal AVW (Anterior Vaginal Wall) is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; significantly thicker than the proximal AVW  and that this region is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the most densely innervated area [10].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This may suggest that some female individuals may have a thicker and more densely innervated distal part of the anterior vaginal wall than other female individuals, which may explain why some women experience orgasms through deep vaginal penetrations and others don't. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jannini, et al., also cite Odile Buisson, a gynecologist from Paris, expert in vaginal echography. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Basically, her position is that the VAO could be caused by contact of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the internal clitoris and the AVW. The proximity of the contact could&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be enhanced by reflex perineal contractions and vasomotor events,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; which occur in the case of erotic stimulation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jannini, et al., also point out that in 1998, there was the discovery that the clitoris and vagina might both play a role together simultaneously during vaginal intercourse. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; During vaginal penetration, in fact, the root of the clitoris is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; stretched by the penis and compressed against the AVW and the pubic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; symphysis [17]. The clitoris and vagina could be seen as an anatomical&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and functional unit being activated by vaginal penetration during&#xD;&#xA;&gt; intercourse. For this reason, and with the aim to involve the urethra&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and the surrounding exocrine glands, Jannini et al. named the area&#xD;&#xA;&gt; triggering the VAO as clito-urethro-vaginal (CUV) complex [22], a name&#xD;&#xA;&gt; probably more correctly able to describe the G-spot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jannini, et al., also cites support for different orgasms (clitoral and vaginal) based on Dr. Brody's findings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Stuart Brody, Professor of Psychology at the University of the West of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Scotland, UK, maintains that orgasm triggered by stimulation of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; vagina and cervix differs physiologically from climax induced by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; clitoral stimulation. He firstly reported a dramatic difference (400%)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in prolactin release (a marker of psychoneuroendocrine involvement)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; when comparing penile-vaginal intercourse (PVI) to masturbation [24].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Dr. Barry R.

But it's important to remember *why* these Europeans left Europe.  Surely there were a plethora of reasons, but one reason in particular stands out as relevant to this discussion: Religious freedom.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A large number of religious groups emigrated to America over the course of several hundred years, often for the purpose of experiencing greater &quot;religious freedom.&quot; How this &quot;religious freedom&quot; was anticipated and/or played out varied according to each group.  But one prominent example still holds sway, by legacy, over much of American society: [The Puritans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritans).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Puritans &quot;sought to reform the Church of England by creating a new, pure church in the New World.&quot;[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_history_of_the_United_States#Puritans).  Massachusetts, New Haven, Saybrook, and Connecticut colonies were all founded by Puritans (New Haven and Saybrook were latere absorbed into Connecticut).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Puritans &quot;hoped this new land would serve as a &quot;redeemer nation&quot;. They fled England and in America attempted to create a &quot;nation of saints&quot; or a &quot;City upon a Hill&quot;: an intensely religious, thoroughly righteous community designed to be an example for all of Europe&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Puritan hegemony lasted for at least a century[&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritans#New_England_Puritans), but its indirect influence is still felt today in American culture and politics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Quakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers#Immigration_to_North_America) also played a significant role in early American colonization, and had significant influence in Pennsylvania (founded by Quaker William Penn), and Rhode Island. (Interestingly, the Quakers fled to the US to avoid Puritan persecution in Europe, only to initially find resistance in the Americas as well, but that's another story...)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many other religious groups came in large groups to the Americas, and later to the US, through at least the late 1800s[&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;](https://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-quarterly-the-migration-of-the-russian-germans-to-kansas/13242) to experience what they perceived as greater religious freedom, or to escape persecution and/or moral depravity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of this to say:  America was, in large part, colonized by Europeans who were not happy with the status quo of European life.  On average, their views on many things were more strict (or &quot;conservative&quot;) than the general population in Europe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This religious fervor, and the moral views that accompany it, naturally had a large and lasting impact.  The campaign in the 1920s and 30s leading to the 18th amendment to the US constitution [prohibiting alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States) was spearheaded by religious people who viewed alcohol as immoral (or at the very least as a sign of immorality).  And to this day, a large portion of US Christians refuse to drink and actively shame those who do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Today Evangelical Christians, the Religious Right, and other formal and informal coalitions of conservative Christians have a very strong hold on certain aspects of society and politics.  This naturally extends to attitudes toward sexuality, nudity, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;America has a long legacy of being morally restrictive and &quot;conservative,&quot; and while those attitudes are changing, changing such ingrained attitudes is naturally slow. In a way, America is (by its own intention and design, in large part), several hundred years behind Europe in overcoming Victorian morality standards." />

I once spent some time compiling **[a list of a dozen different kinds of orgasms][1]** based on distinctions that are important in talking about tantric sex.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the common attempts to classify orgasms based on the anatomical location of the stimulus (clitoris, vagina, anus, nipples, &quot;core&quot; muscles, etc.) or the thing providing the stimulus (fingers, tongue, penis, vibrator, etc.) seem destined to fail because of the inconsistencies among different women and even among the perceptions of the same woman at different times:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**[Why Some Orgasms Feel Different][2]**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Part of the general confusion and debate about orgasms stems from the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; assumption that orgasms from the same source feel the same for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; different women.  In reality, orgasms can vary quite a lot in how they&#xD;&#xA;&gt; feel, how long they last, and how intense they are, based on the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; duration of stimulation, how the woman feels about her partner or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; situation, how physically relaxed and mentally comfortable she is, how&#xD;&#xA;&gt; she feels about the different kinds of stimuli, and a lot of other&#xD;&#xA;&gt; factors. A woman will experience orgasms very differently if she is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; tired and tense, or rested and relaxed. And a woman who perceives&#xD;&#xA;&gt; vaginal sex as boring and oral sex as exciting will experience orgasms&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from those two sources quite differently from a woman who regards&#xD;&#xA;&gt; vaginal sex as normal and loving, and oral sex as dirty and wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The likelihood of a woman having an orgasm and the nature of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; orgasms she does have can both be affected a great deal by factors&#xD;&#xA;&gt; such as body image issues, whether the lights are on or off, and the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; degree of confidence she has in the bond with her partner. For&#xD;&#xA;&gt; example, a woman who feels, consciously or unconsciously, that her&#xD;&#xA;&gt; private parts are smelly or unattractive may have orgasms from oral&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sex that she experiences as short, “sharp,” “hard,” or otherwise&#xD;&#xA;&gt; unpleasant, while the same woman may thoroughly enjoy longer, more&#xD;&#xA;&gt; mellow, or more intense orgasms from manual stimulation (her own or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; her partner’s), even though both are “clitoral” orgasms. So the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; determining factor is not the location of the stimulus so much as it&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is all of the emotions and preconceptions that are bundled with it,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; including especially her ideas about different areas of her body and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; her comfort with her own or her partner’s activities.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Given all of the possible influences, it is not surprising that most&#xD;&#xA;&gt; women experience orgasms differently depending on the circumstances&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and the sexual activity involved. But there is little consistency as&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to the differences when women are compared to each other. This has led&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to passionate debates between those who argue that one kind of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; orgasmic stimulation is “better” than another, but ultimately the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; arguments are meaningless. Most women can have better orgasms in some&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ways than in others, but which way is best, or preferred, for any&#xD;&#xA;&gt; given woman is almost completely idiosyncratic, and can change&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dramatically as the setting and circumstances and her own attitudes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and experience change.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://moderntantra.blogspot.com/2013/10/types-of-orgasms.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://moderntantra.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-female-orgasm.html" />

From the few articles I could find that seemed unbiased, there's still a large list of pros and cons. Note that most studies are actually about the *long-term* effects of masturbation. Scientists and doctors tend to want to know more about what will happen in twenty years if do something *now*, so they can extend your life. I couldn't find a single *study* that focused only on the short-term effects, so I'm going to compile what I found here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most people (including non-experts, sex therapists, doctors, etc) tend to agree that sufferers of premature ejaculation can try to masturbate before having sex, but that &quot;normal&quot; people, those that can go about five minutes after penetration, should avoid using this technique too frequently, because they would risk not being able to perform. There also was no consensus on the correct timing, which I assume indicates that the correct timing is actually dependent on the person with the problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, this technique cannot be considered &quot;reliable.&quot; Some people report less pleasurable sex, inability to perform, no effect, or even a decrease in performance time (e.g. makes premature ejaculation even *worse*). Several articles I scanned suggests that masturbation is one of several therapy options for those trying to increase their stamina, including thicker condoms to decrease sensitivity, and therapy (e.g. it may be their mental state causing the problem).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Strictly speaking, there's no harm in trying occasionally, but someone trying to do so should experiment for the best results. It may be 30 minutes before an encounter, an hour, or longer, or may require multiple back-to-back orgasms to have the desired effect. There are inherent dangers with masturbating too much and/or having too much sex, so if the person is already quite active (multiple times per day), they should avoid masturbation on top of it, and should probably cut back a little bit. Conversely, if a person is having sex less than once a week, they should probably masturbate a least a couple times a week for health benefits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, there's the matter of *how* it should be done. I'm not referring to a specific motion, but simply that the person should actively concentrate on *not* having an orgasm for as long as possible, otherwise they're not doing their body a favor. A person certainly won't learn to increase their stamina if all they do is work to achieve the fastest &quot;quickie&quot; they can. Time should be allocated before hand and they should work up to a nice, leisurely orgasm over several minutes, perhaps even as much as 30 minutes. Each session should focus on different motions, speeds, and so on to maximize stamina.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that most scientists agree that masturbation can provide a slew of long-term health benefits, including a healthier heart, lungs, muscles, memory, and emotional state (less depressed/sadness). One should consider the wide range of effects that one can benefit from just by masturbating once a week, but shouldn't necessarily expect any performance gains simply by masturbating. Other factors that will improve performance include Kegel exercises, quitting smoking and/or drinking, eating a healthy balanced diet, etc." />

If each party can have a compassionate understanding for what's going on with the other party, perhaps some creative solutions can be worked on between them, that actually work towards solving *both parties*' needs. A few specific ideas on what this might look like, below.&#xD;&#xA;1. **Creative Signaling** - Perhaps instead of approaching partner B, and asking for sex, partner A could place an object somewhere, that's been a pre-arranged signal that partner A is craving sex.  It's then up to partner B to initiate an interaction, which may or may not include sex, but would hopefully at least validate partner A's desire for it.  The signaling might also go the other direction.  Perhaps partner B might have a way to signal that they'd be receptive to approaches from partner A, say.  Or a different signal to say that this would be a poor time for it.&#xD;&#xA;1. **Scheduling** - *some* people find that knowing when this might be coming allows them to plan their mental space, and be more ready for sex.  If partner B is such a person, then perhaps partner A could request a time on the calendar for their next sexual encounter.  Or perhaps there'd be a regular interval set up.  Different people will have different ideas about frequency, amount of warning required, etc., so go back to point #1 and communicate about what might work in this regard.&#xD;&#xA;1. **Masturbation** - many people find that masturbation can be helpful for resolving sexual tension.  Also, some people find that when watching a partner masturbate, they end up getting turned on, and masturbation turns into sex.&#xD;&#xA;1. **Consensual non-monogamy** - some people with high libidos, for example, find that they can have their sexual desires better filled by having multiple partners.  Some partners of such people feel a great sense of relief when their partner finds (an)other partner(s), because now they're not feeling pressured all the time.  Of course, this is a vast subject unto itself, and offers a variety of challenges to someone not already inclined towards this path.  That said, it's one option that people could explore.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't have enough knowledge about what advice sex therapists or relationship counselors might give, so I'm afraid I'm unable to answer that question.  I also don't quite feel qualified to say much about the gender dynamics question, except to say that it's definitely the case that many people do find gender-role dynamics to be relevant in situations like this, even in non-straight couples.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully the above tips will qualify as a helpful answer to the initial question, though, even if an incomplete one." />

[tag:terminology] therefore should be used for identifying and describing the unique sexual terminology present in many cultures around the globe. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This tag is appropriate for questions such as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/q/277/124&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/q/5/124&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - http://sexuality.stackexchange.com/q/263/124&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;Whilst collecting and answering terminology questions is within the mandate of Sexuality.SE, questions should avoid repository-style questions that seek to span large cross-sections of the terminology graph. Single questions which ask for a list of answers (with one term per answer) do not fit well into the engine and are likely to be closed." />
